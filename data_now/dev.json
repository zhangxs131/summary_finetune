At a Chinese shipyard, the keel-laying ceremony was held for a barge that will later be fitted with two RITM-200S reactors.\nThe keel laying ceremony (Image: Atomenergomash)\nThe barge will measure 140 metres long and 30 metres wide, said Rosatom, and will feature structures for containment and radioactive waste storage as well as fuel tanks for diesel, according to previous TASS reports. On delivery to Atomenergomash by the end of next year the barge will weigh 9549 tons and when fitted out with two RITM-200S pressurised water reactors and all the equipment it needs to function as a power plant it will weigh some 19,088 tons. The reactor components are already being manufactured.\nAtomflot will then take control as the owner and operator of the floating nuclear power plant when it is complete. It will be transferred to Cape Nagloynyn in the Russian Arctic where it will supply 105 MWe to a new port and the forthcoming Baimskaya copper and gold mine. This is scheduled to happen by 2027.\nIn total, the Baimskaya development requires around 300 MWe, therefore three such floating power plants are needed, while a fourth will be installed as backup for outages during refuelling and maintenance.\nAndrey Nikipelov, head of Atomenergomash said: \"This project begins the history of a whole family of floating nuclear power plants, different in capacity and purpose - in the Arctic and tropical versions, which Atomenergomash is ready to offer to the market and which undoubtedly have a very serious potential for the implementation of large industrial projects and exports.\"\nRussia already has one floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, which is stationed at Pevek where it supplies heat and power to the town. This is based on two KLT-40S reactors generating 35 MWe each, which are similar to those used in a previous generation of nuclear powered icebreakers. So-called 'modernised floating nuclear power plants' like the ones for Cape Nagloynyn feature reactors from the new RITM series, as used in the latest generation of icebreakers. RITM units can also be used on land and a single-reactor plant is planned for Ust-Kuyga in Russia's far east.\nNo specific name was given to the new barge, and the overall project comprising four floating power plants and eight reactors is known simply as Cape Nagloynyn. Rosatom announced the ceremony without specifying exactly which shipyard was doing the work, but in November last year it was reported by TASS to be Wison Heavy Industries, a specialist in large offshore platforms with a manufacturing base in Nantong.\n", "中文原文": "2022年8月31日Nagloynyn角项目的四个浮动核电站中的第一个已经开始建设，该项目将为俄罗斯北极的一个巨大矿业开发提供动力。在一家中国造船厂，为一艘驳船举行了龙骨铺设仪式，这艘驳船稍后将安装两个RITM-200S反应堆。龙骨铺设仪式（图片：Atomenergomash）据塔斯社此前报道，罗萨托姆说，这艘驳船长140米，宽30米，将有安全壳和放射性废物储存结构以及柴油燃料箱。明年年底交付给Atomenergomash后，这艘驳船将重9549吨，当配备两个RITM-200S压水反应堆和作为发电厂所需的所有设备时，它将重约19088吨。反应堆组件已经在制造中。Atomflot随后将作为浮动核电站的所有者和运营商获得控制权。它将被转移到俄罗斯北极的Nagloynyn角，在那里它将向一个新港口和即将到来的Baimskaya铜金矿供应105兆瓦。这将于2027年实现。Baimskaya的开发总共需要大约300兆瓦，因此需要三个这样的浮动发电厂，同时将安装第四个，作为加油和维护期间停电的后备。Atomenergomash负责人安德烈·尼基佩洛夫（Andrey Nikipelov）表示：“该项目开启了一整套浮动核电站的历史，它们的容量和用途不同--在北极和热带版本中，Atomenergomash准备向市场提供这些核电站，无疑对实施大型工业项目和出口具有非常大的潜力。”俄罗斯已经有一个浮动核电站，阿卡德米克·罗蒙诺索夫，驻扎在佩韦克，为该镇提供热量和电力。这是基于两个每个产生35兆瓦的KLT-40S反应堆，与上一代核动力破冰船使用的反应堆相似。所谓的“现代化浮动核电站”，如Nagloynyn角的核电站，采用了新RITM系列的反应堆，用于最新一代破冰船。RITM机组也可以在陆地上使用，并计划在俄罗斯远东的乌斯特-库伊加建立一个单反应堆工厂。没有给出新驳船的具体名称，包括四个浮动发电厂和八个反应堆的整个项目被简单地称为Nagloynyn角。Rosatom宣布了仪式，但没有具体说明哪家造船厂在做这项工作，但去年11月，据塔斯社报道，该造船厂是威森重工，一家大型海上平台专家，在南通设有制造基地。", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯下一座浮动核电站开工建设", "英文整编": "The first floating nuclear power plant of Cape Nagloynyn project in Russia has started construction.

They include increasing the use of multi-year contracts, simplifying program requirements, securing supply chains to eliminate delays in production, supporting industry recruitment efforts, and securing access to private funding networks for France’s defense industry.\nMeanwhile, Norway last month announced a deal worth 2.6 billion Krone (U.S. $257 million) to procure artillery shells from Nammo, in a deal hailed by the nation’s defense minister as the largest ever,according to reports.\nThe United States has also focused on replenishing its munitions stockpiles, though some defense firms have signaled they won’t expand capacity without firm government commitments in spite of growing defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe U.S. Congress has backed multiyear purchases of certain munitions, and U.S. Army officials say they are undergoing the fastest artillery ramp up since the Korean War.\nWhile some munition production boosts have begun, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks is leading an effort to unclog industrial bottlenecks.\n", "中文原文": "比维维埃内马奇2月13日08:46PM布鲁塞尔--着眼于乌克兰保护自己免受俄罗斯持续进攻的需求，北约计划实施新的库存指导方针，同时与成员国的国防工业合作，增加自己的武库，同时继续填充基辅的武库。北约秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格周一在布鲁塞尔总部对记者发表讲话时，直言不讳地评估了弹药库存和交付时间。“目前的弹药消耗率更高，大于目前的生产率。这是事实，“斯托尔滕贝格说。例如，军方领取大口径弹药的等待时间从12个月增加到28个月。“今天下的订单只能在两年半后交付，”他补充说。他说，在过去的几个月里，北约对其库存进行了“非同寻常的、非周期的”调查，并计划在2月14日至15日的国防部长会议上决定新的能力目标指导方针。他指出，近一年前，当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，北约盟国发现，支持保卫国家对火炮需求的唯一方法是“挖掘我们现有的库存”。“但当然，从长远来看，我们不能继续这样做。”斯托尔滕贝格说，北约成员国正在与各自的国防工业合作，为弹药和其他防御能力启动新的多年采购协议。法国国防部上周宣布了五项旨在支持生产周期的新行动。这些措施包括增加多年期合同的使用，简化项目要求，确保供应链的安全以消除生产延误，支持行业招聘工作，以及确保法国国防工业进入私人融资网络。与此同时，据报道，挪威上个月宣布了一项价值26亿克朗（2.57亿美元）的协议，从Nammo购买炮弹，这是该国国防部长称赞的有史以来最大的协议。美国还专注于补充其弹药储备，尽管一些国防公司表示，尽管俄罗斯入侵乌克兰推动了国防支出和武器需求的增长，但如果没有政府的坚定承诺，他们不会扩大产能。美国国会支持多年购买某些弹药，美国陆军官员表示，他们正在经历自朝鲜战争以来最快的火炮增兵。虽然一些弹药生产已经开始增加，但美国国防部副部长凯瑟琳·希克斯（Kathleen Hicks）正在领导一项疏通工业瓶颈的努力。", "中文源标题": "关注乌克兰，北约准备新的弹药指导方针以提高产量", "英文整编": "Considering Ukraine's need to protect itself from the continued Russian offensive, NATO plans to implement new ammunition stockpile guidelines, while cooperating with member countries' defense industries to increase its own stockpiles while continuing to support Ukraine.NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg said that the current ammunition consumption rate is higher than the production rate.

Photo from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine via Facebook.\nFor months now, Ukraine has faced a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks, straining its Soviet-era air defenses. But as the U.S. and its allies work to provide Ukraine with upgraded technology to defend against those strikes, an open-source intelligence analysis has found the Russian missiles have plenty of U.S. technology of their own.\nIn a Jan. 10 briefing, analysts from the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies, detailed how many of Russia’s missiles have American and other Western components, despite export controls in place.\n“All of these pieces of equipment were absolutely filled with Western components,” James Byrne, the Director of the Open Source Intelligence and Analysis Research Group at RUSI, said. “For us, it’s very interesting, very surprising. Nearly everything that we found in those systems was manufactured, designed by American companies.”\nBryne said RUSI was able to conduct its extensive assessments in part because Ukraine has offered up weapons it has shot down, captured, or collected the wreckage of, for inspection by analysts. \n“As the course of the war progressed, a lot of the components that we saw in these platforms and that we have since seen in these platforms are relatively new,” Byrne said. “The Russians have been doing it for a really long time, and they’re still doing it now.” \nByrne said the two largest suppliers of tech it found in Russian weapons were the U.S.-based Analog Devices and Texas Instruments—much of that technology has non-military applications, making a crackdown on their export harder. And according to the British think tank, Russia has various schemes to smuggle technology into the country, including front companies in third countries. \nThe U.S. has put in place expansive export controls to prevent American technology and goods from heading to Russia since Moscow’s renewed invasion begin in February 2022. That’s on top of other steps the U.S. took after the original Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, including the strengthening of export controls on weapons technology. \nHowever, according to RUSI, some of the weapons used by Russia in Ukraine have been made in the past year. \n“It’s always been the case that there was a huge interest in acquiring American technology,” Byrne said. “Despite Russian efforts to sort of build this sort of domestic homegrown semiconductor industry, despite the propaganda, despite the discussion about import substitution, they haven’t succeeded in doing that. I personally don’t think they will ever really be able to succeed in doing that. And so it leaves them really critically dependent on foreign technology.” \nThe Department of Commerce did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Air & Space Forces Magazine on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls. \nAs Russia has continued to pummel Ukrainian infrastructure this winter, the U.S. and its allies have sought to provide Ukraine with an integrated, modern air and missile defense network. Most recently, both the U.S. and Germany have pledged to give the Ukrainians one of its more advanced systems: the PATRIOT air defense system.\nOn Jan. 10, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder announced that Ukrainian soldiers will begin training to operate the PATRIOT at Fort Sill, the same place American troops are trained on the system, as soon as next week.\nDoing so will require Ukraine to pull some troops off the front lines; Training on a U.S. PATRIOT battery takes several months, though it could be expedited by skipping some steps deemed nonessential. \n“The longer those troops are off the line, they’re not actually engaged in combat, and so [we’re] trying to work with the Ukrainians to see what we can do to accelerate the training timeline,” Ryder said. “In terms of what that training will look like, it will consist of training in the classrooms, it will consist of training on the PATRIOT systems, and then of course, in a simulation lab as well before they actually deploy the capability on the battlefield.” \nRyder said Ukraine plans to send soldiers already trained in air defense to Fort Sill, where the Ukrainian troops will be instructed by the same teachers used for U.S. and allied troops who operate the system. Around 90 Ukrainians will be trained, which is the same number of troops the U.S. uses to operate its PATRIOT batteries. \nRyder also stressed the importance of not cutting too many corners in the training process, citing lessons learned from watching the Russians struggle with combined arms maneuvers due to poor training and techniques, leaving their advanced equipment less useful.\n“My understanding is that nothing will be done that would prevent this from being employed to the maximum, most effective way possible,” Ryder said. “If give you a piece of equipment, I’m simply giving you a piece of equipment, but if I give you the equipment and I give you the training, I now give you a capability. So that’s really essential here to ensuring that not only do the Ukrainians have the equipment they need to fight, but also the training that’s going to enable them to operate it on the frontline.” \n", "中文原文": "据报道，2022年11月15日，乌克兰军队在该国南部地区击落了一枚俄罗斯导弹的残骸。照片来自乌克兰武装部队总参谋部通过脸书。几个月来，乌克兰一直面临俄罗斯导弹和无人机的接二连三的袭击，使其苏联时代的防空紧张。但随着美国及其盟友努力向乌克兰提供升级的技术来防御这些袭击，一项开源情报分析发现，俄罗斯导弹拥有大量自己的美国技术。在1月10日的一次简报中，皇家战略研究所的分析师详细说明了俄罗斯有多少导弹拥有美国和其他西方部件，尽管实施了出口管制。“所有这些设备都绝对充满了西方组件，”RUSI开源情报和分析研究组主任詹姆斯·伯恩说。“对我们来说，这非常有趣，非常令人惊讶。我们在这些系统中发现的几乎所有东西都是由美国公司制造和设计的。“布莱恩说，RUSI能够进行广泛的评估，部分原因是乌克兰提供了它击落、捕获或收集的武器，供分析师检查。伯恩说：“随着战争进程的进展，我们在这些平台上看到的许多组件以及我们后来在这些平台上看到的许多组件都是相对较新的。”“俄罗斯人已经做了很长时间了，他们现在还在做。”伯恩说，它在俄罗斯武器中发现的两个最大的技术供应商是总部位于美国的模拟器件和德克萨斯仪器公司--这些技术中的许多都有非军事应用，这使得对它们出口的打击更加困难。根据英国智库的说法，俄罗斯有各种向该国走私技术的计划，包括第三国的幌子公司。自2022年2月莫斯科开始再次入侵以来，美国已经实施了广泛的出口管制，以防止美国技术和商品流向俄罗斯。这是美国在2014年俄罗斯最初入侵乌克兰后采取的其他措施之一，包括加强对武器技术的出口控制。不过，按照鲁西的说法，俄罗斯在乌克兰使用的一些武器是过去一年制造的。伯恩说：“一直以来，人们对获得美国技术有着巨大的兴趣。”“尽管俄罗斯努力建立这种国内本土半导体产业，尽管宣传，尽管关于进口替代的讨论，但他们没有成功做到这一点。我个人认为他们永远不会真正成功做到这一点。因此，这使得他们非常严重地依赖外国技术。“美国商务部没有立即回复《空军与太空部队》杂志就美国出口管制的有效性发表评论的请求。随着俄罗斯今年冬天继续轰炸乌克兰的基础设施，美国及其盟友寻求为乌克兰提供一个一体化的现代空中和导弹防御网络。最近，美国和德国都承诺给乌克兰人一个更先进的系统：爱国者防空系统。1月10日，五角大楼新闻秘书帕特里克·赖德准将宣布，乌克兰士兵最早将于下周开始在希尔堡训练操作爱国者，希尔堡是美国军队在该系统上接受训练的地方。这样做将要求乌克兰从前线撤出一些军队；在美国爱国者电池上的训练需要几个月的时间，尽管可以通过跳过一些被认为不重要的步骤来加快训练。赖德说：“这些部队离开线的时间越长，他们实际上就没有参与战斗，所以（我们）正试图与乌克兰人合作，看看我们能做些什么来加快训练时间表。”“就训练的样子而言，它将包括在教室里的训练，它将包括在爱国者系统上的训练，当然，在他们在战场上实际部署能力之前，也包括在模拟实验室里的训练。”赖德说，乌克兰计划向希尔堡派遣已经接受过防空训练的士兵，在那里乌克兰军队将接受操作该系统的美国和盟军军队使用的相同教师的指导。大约90名乌克兰人将接受训练，这与美国用来操作爱国者电池的军队人数相同。赖德还强调了在训练过程中不要偷工减料的重要性，他引用了从观察俄罗斯人因训练和技术差而在联合武器机动中挣扎中吸取的教训，这使得他们的先进设备不太有用。赖德说：“我的理解是，没有什么能阻止这一点得到最大限度、最有效的利用。”“如果给你一块等分", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯对乌克兰使用的导弹“绝对充满”美国技术", "英文整编": "On January 10th, the Royal Joint Services Research Institute (RUSI) issued a briefing saying that although the United States has strict export control to Russia, some Russian missiles are equipped with weapon components developed and produced by the United States and other Western countries.

That large area is needed since the spacecraft will be flying out to Jupiter’s distance from the sun, where the sunlight is only a few percent as powerful as at Earth. “That enables Lucy to travel further away from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft to date,” said Katie Oakman, Lucy structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, at the Oct. 14 briefing. Lockheed was the prime contractor for Lucy, although the solar arrays were built by Northrop Grumman.\nIn the vicinity of the Earth, Lucy’s panels can generate 18 kilowatts of power. However, when flying by the Trojan asteroids that are the destination of the mission, the arrays will produce only 500 watts of power, still sufficient to operate the spacecraft and its three main instruments.\nShe added there was no specific design requirement for circular arrays versus more conventional rectangular ones, but that those offered the most area while fitting in the confines of the Atlas payload fairing. “This particular design really enables us to stow up closely and tightly next to the spacecraft for launch,” she said. “Having any particular shape other than this really unique design wouldn’t enable us to get to that 51-meter-squared of active cell area and still fit within the launch vehicle fairing.”\nIt’s unclear if the problem will affect other work to check out the spacecraft after its launch.

Credit: Jaoui et al.\nMagic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a graphene-based material with a unique structure, consisting of two graphene sheets layered on top of each other with a misalignment of approximately 1.1°. This unique structure has been found to host various interesting states, including correlated insulating states and unconventional superconductivity.\nPast studies examining MATBG also unveiled the emergence of what is known as a \"strange\" metal regime in the proximity of the superconducting dome, as well as a significantly enhanced electron-phonon coupling. While these observations were confirmed by later works, the exact mechanisms underpinning them remain unclear.\nResearchers at the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, the National Institute for Material Sciences, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have recently taken a closer look at these properties of MATBG using a different, low temperature phase diagram than those utilized in previous works. Their paper, published in Nature Physics, gathered new valuable insight about the material's quantum critical behavior.\n\"Early reports on the electrical transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene revealed two fascinating features: the emergence of a so-called 'strange' metal regime in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and a sharply enhanced electron-phonon coupling,\" Alexandre Jaoui, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"Yet, both features share, under certain conditions, a common signature: a linear-in-temperature resistivity. One question that arose was: can a single microscopic mechanism, electrons scattering off phonons, account for both previous observations? Or is this signature, in the low temperature region, pointing to the existence of additional scattering centers affecting charge carriers?\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nA schematic phase diagram of the metallic ground state of hole-doped magic-angle graphene with a single superconducting dome. Credit: Jaoui et al.\nThe answers to these so-far elusive questions can only be found by examining MATBG at low temperatures, where phonons (i.e., quasiparticles associated with waves such as sound or vibration) are suppressed. In the MATBG devices reported in previous literature, however, the metallic ground state was typically hidden by an array of phase transitions.\n\"We proposed to take advantage of our 'screened' devices, in which the correlated insulators are suppressed, to study magic-angle graphene with a much simpler low-temperature phase diagram: a single superconducting dome enclosed in a metallic phase,\" Jaoui explained. \"This allowed us to focus on the latter state.\"\nTo fabricate their MATBG structure, Jaoui and his colleagues used a 'cut-and-stack' method often used by research teams examining 2D heterostructures. To encapsulate their device they used a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).\n\"The proximity of the graphene layers to the metallic gate allows us to suppress the low temperature insulating states and thus grants further access to the metallic ground state,\" Jaoui said. \"We then collected measurements using conventional quantum transport techniques (i.e., DC electrical transport).\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nThe research team who carried out the study. From left to right: Ipsita Das, Alexandre Jaoui, Jaime Díez-Mérida, Giorgio di Battista, Dmitri K. Efetov\nThe measurements gathered by Jaoui and his colleagues confirmed the occurrence of the same 'strange' metal behavior reported in previous studies (i.e., a linear-in-T resistivity with a Planckian scattering rate). However, the team's study shows that this behavior extends to temperatures far below the Bloch-Grüneisen temperature while the system has a finite Fermi temperature. Moreover, their findings highlight an additional signature of strange metallicity, namely an enhanced linear magnetoresistance.\n\"Perhaps the most interesting part of this study, however, is the recovery of the archetypal behavior of a disordered dilute & correlated metal, the Fermi liquid behavior, away from the superconducting dome,\" Jaoui said. \"This evolution suggests that fluctuations of a yet-to-be-determined nature dominate the metallic ground state in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and drive the low-temperature linear resistivity.\"\nOverall, the findings gathered by this team of researchers suggest that quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG might be related. In the future, their work could inspire new studies examining this possibility and the quantum-critical phase observed in this study further.\n\"We are now investigating the evolution of the metallic ground state as a function of the 'twist-angle' of twisted bilayer graphene,\" Jaoui added. \"This is, in a very simplistic manner, a knob tuning the strength of the electronic correlations. We will soon publish further report on the metallic ground state of twisted bilayer graphene.\"\n", "中文原文": "由研究人员创建的设备的光学图像。功劳：贾维等人。魔角扭曲双层石墨烯(MATBG)是一种具有独特结构的石墨烯基材料，由两片石墨烯以约1.1°的错位相互层叠而成。这种独特的结构被发现承载了各种有趣的态，包括关联绝缘态和非常规超导。过去对MATBG的研究还揭示了在超导穹顶附近出现了一种被称为“奇怪”的金属机制，以及显著增强的电子-声子耦合。虽然这些观察被后来的工作证实，但支撑它们的确切机制仍不清楚。巴塞罗那科学技术研究所、国家材料科学研究所和麻省理工学院(MIT)的研究人员最近使用了一种不同于以前工作中使用的低温相图，对MATBG的这些性质进行了更仔细的研究。他们的论文发表在《自然物理学》上，收集了关于这种材料的量子临界行为的新的有价值的见解。开展这项研究的研究人员之一亚历山大·贾维（Alexandre Jaoui）告诉Phys.org，“关于扭曲双层石墨烯电输运性质的早期报告揭示了两个迷人的特征：在超导穹顶附近出现了所谓的‘奇怪’金属区，以及急剧增强的电子-声子耦合。”然而，在某些条件下，这两种特征都有一个共同的特征：温度内的线性电阻率。由此产生的一个问题是：一种单一的微观机制--电子从声子上散射--能解释以前的两种观察吗？或者，在低温区，这种特征表明存在着影响电荷载流子的附加散射中心？魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为单超导穹顶空穴掺杂幻角石墨烯金属基态相图。功劳：贾维等人。这些迄今为止难以捉摸的问题的答案只能通过在低温下检查MATBG来找到，在低温下，声子（即与声音或振动等波相关的准粒子）被抑制。然而，在以往文献报道的MATBG器件中，金属基态通常被一系列相变所隐藏。“我们提议利用我们的‘屏蔽’设备，其中相关绝缘体被抑制，以一种更简单的低温相图来研究魔角石墨烯：一个封闭在金属相中的单一超导穹顶，”贾维解释说。“这让我们可以专注于后一种状态。”为了制造他们的MATBG结构，Jaoui和他的同事使用了一种“切割叠加”方法，这种方法通常是研究团队在研究二维异质结构时使用的。为了封装他们的器件，他们使用了一层薄薄的六方氮化硼(hBN)。Jaoui说：“石墨烯层靠近金属栅使我们能够抑制低温绝缘态，从而进一步获得金属基态。”然后，我们使用传统的量子传输技术（即直流电传输）收集测量结果。魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为进行这项研究的研究小组。从左到右：伊普斯塔·达斯、亚历山大·贾维、海梅·迪耶斯-梅里达、乔治·迪·巴蒂斯塔、德米特里·埃费托夫Jaoui和他的同事收集的测量结果证实了以前研究中报道的同样的“奇怪”金属行为的发生（即，线性电阻率与普朗克散射率）。然而，该小组的研究表明，这种行为扩展到远低于布洛赫-格吕内森温度的温度，而该系统有有限的费米温度。此外，他们的发现突出了一个奇怪的金属性的额外特征，即增强的线性磁电阻。“然而，这项研究最有趣的部分可能是在超导穹顶之外恢复无序稀相关金属的原型行为，即费米液体行为，”Jaoui说。“这一演化表明，一种尚未确定的性质的涨落主导了超导穹顶附近的金属基态，并驱动了低温线性电阻率。”总的来说，这组研究人员收集的发现表明，MATBG中的量子涨落和超导电性可能有关。在未来，他们的工作可能会激发新的研究，进一步检验这种可能性和在这项研究中观察到的量子临界阶段。“我们现在正在研究金属基态的演化，作为扭曲双层石墨烯‘扭曲角’的函数，”Jaoui补充道。“这是以一种非常简单的方式，", "中文源标题": "魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为", "英文整编": "Magic angle twisted double-layer graphene (MATBG) is a graphene-based material, which has a unique structure composed of two graphene sheets superimposed, and the dislocation angle is about 1. 1 °. This unique structure makes it have many excellent properties, including excellent insulation and superconductivity.Previous studies have revealed two characteristics of MATBG, one is the metal region near the superconducting dome, and the other is the significantly enhanced electron-phonon coupling phenomenon. Although these observations were later confirmed, the exact mechanism supporting them is still unclear. The answers to these questions can only be tried by checking MATBG at low temperature. However, it has been reported that the phonons in the ground state of metal in MATBG components are usually hidden by a series of phase transitions. To solve this problem, researchers from MIT cooperated with Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology and National Institute of Materials Science to design a shielding device, in which related insulators were suppressed, so as to study magic angle graphene with simpler low-temperature phase diagram.To make MATBG structures, the team adopted the \"cut stack\" method often used when examining two-dimensional heterostructures. The proximity of graphene layer to metal gate enables it to suppress the low-temperature insulation state, thus further entering the metal ground state, and then collecting the measured values using traditional quantum transmission technology.The results show that the linear magnetoresistance of the structural material is significantly enhanced. In addition, it is found that the material has Fermi liquid behavior, which indicates that the fluctuation of undetermined properties dominates the metal ground state near the superconducting dome and promotes the linear resistivity at low temperature.In a word, by analyzing the collected research results, it can be concluded that the correlation between quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG is very strong. In the future, the team will carry out new research to test this possibility and further observe the quantum critical stage found in this study."}, {"中文标题": "美国开发出基于光频梳技术的芯片级碳化硅宽带光源", "情报来源": "物理学组织网站", "时间": "2022年3月18日", "整编内容": "近日，由美国卡内基梅隆大学电子与计算机工程系的一个研究小组开发出一种基于光学频率梳技术的芯片级碳化硅宽带光源，该光源一般被用作磨料或用于高温高压下工作的电子设备。光频梳负责测量红外线、紫外线、温室气体、原子钟和疾病，就像一把测量光线的尺子。而碳化硅因其独特的性质成为一种非常有前途的材料，可用于量子应用。在新研究中，研究人员利用碳化硅和光频梳技术在克莱尔·贝尔图奇纳米技术实验室制造出了尺寸小于0.1 mm的微型光学设备，大约相当于一张纸的厚度。研究人员表示，设备的制造过程是经过精心优化的，以确定产生具有光滑表面的微小环形结构。由于共振效应，被限制在这些微环中的光经历了显著的功率增强，共振效应足以引起克尔光学非线性响应。该研究使强大信息处理器的研发成为可能，为开发全新微型电子设备铺平了道路。", "关键词": "光学频率梳 碳化硅 宽带光源 量子应用 信息处理器 共振效应 克尔效应 光学非线性相应", "整编机构": "国家工业信息安全发展研究中心", "源网址": "https://phys.org/news/2022-03-chip-scale-broadband-source-silicon-carbide.html", "源标题": "A chip-scale broadband light source in silicon carbide", "原文": "Optical frequency combs have changed science and technology as we know it.

Ultimately, such methods could significantly aid the design, prediction, analysis and control of complex physical systems.\nSo far, traditional methods based on linear theory achieved poor performances when reconstructing global fields for complex physical systems or processes, particularly when only a limited amount of sensor data is available or when sensors are randomly positioned. In recent years, computer scientists have thus been exploring the potential of alternative methods for global field reconstruction, including deep learning models.\nResearchers at Keio University in Japan, University of California- Los Angeles and other institutes in the U.S. have recently developed a new deep learning tool that can accurately reconstruct global fields without the need for extensive and highly organized sensor data. This method, introduced in a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence, could open new interesting possibilities for several areas of research, including geophysics, astrophysics and atmospheric science.\n\"Achieving accurate and robust global situational awareness of a complex time-evolving field from a limited number of sensors has been a long-standing challenge,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues wrote in their paper. \"This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are sparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems.\"\nWhen studying atmospheric phenomena, astrophysical processes and other complex physical systems, researchers often only have access to data collected by a limited number of sensors positioned in unorganized ways. In some instances, these sensors can also be moving and may go offline for some periods of time.\nThis lack of ideal sensor data has so far made it difficult to reconstruct global fields for these complex systems. While deep learning techniques have achieved some promising results, implementing them can often be highly expensive and computationally demanding.\nThe global field reconstruction technique developed by Fukami and his colleagues merges deep learning with Voronoi tessellation, a way of representing and describing biological structures or physical systems. In the past, Voronoi tessellations or diagrams have been used in many areas of science and engineering.\n\"We propose a data-driven spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues explained in their paper. \"We consider the use of Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor locations, enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\"\nThe technique created by the researchers incorporates the data collected by sparse sensors into a CNN, approximating local information onto a structured representation, while retaining data related to the location of sensors. To do this, it constructs a Voronoi tessellation of the unstructured dataset and then adds the input data field corresponding to the location of the sensors, implementing it as a mask.\nTwo advantageous features of this method for global field reconstruction are that it is compatible with deep learning-based techniques that have proved promising for advanced image processing and it can also be implemented with an arbitrary number of sensors. So far, the researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach by using it to reconstruct global fields using three different sets of sensor data, namely unsteady wake flow, geophysical data and 3D turbulence data.\nIn contrast with previously proposed methods, the tool developed by Fukami and his colleagues also works with data collected by a random number of moving sensors.

We think NASA is the right place initially, we’re open for other options and debate on this.”\nThe two-hour “listening session” provided industry reps, scientists and interested members of the public with an opportunity to weigh in on the White House’s “National Orbital Debris Research and Development Plan” [PDF] issued last January in the waning days of the Trump administration.\nIn early November, the Biden administrationannouncedthat OSTP would be updating the plan, which had been criticized by a number of experts as simply touting more research on already widely understood problems, and opened a public comment period through the end of the year. The request specifically asked for input on “what R&D areas are priorities for government-sponsored initiatives/coordination, the roles of academia, nonprofit, and industry actors in addressing these actions, and potential avenues for coordination between actors across public and private sectors.”\nTo follow up, on Dec. 17 OSTP announced [PDF] that it would hold two town-hall type virtual opportunities for oral comments as follows:\n·Jan. 13, Debris Mediation:“the active or passive manipulation of debris objects to reduce or eliminate the risk they pose to operational space assets. This may include fully removing debris from orbit, moving debris from orbits that pose a high risk to operational spacecraft into lower-risk orbits, and finding ways to repurpose or recycle existing debris.”\n·Jan. 20, Debris Mitigation:which refers to “limiting the creation of new debris through deliberate spacecraft and launch vehicle design choices.”\nThe Thursday meeting at times resembled the TV comedy Seinfeld’s Festivus celebration’s “airing of grievances,” and at other times descended into what could only be seen as shameless self-promotion of various tech companies’ wares. That said, there was widespread accord on a number of recommendations.\nFor example, aside from the issues of responsibility and funding, numerous commenters noted the need to lower the 25-year time deadline for removing defunct satellites from LEO — which the Trump administration’s2019 rewrite of US space debris mitigation guidelinesretained after a fierce inter-agency fight.\nAnother common thread was on the need for the Commerce Department to quit stalling on providing NOAA’sOffice of Space Commerceadequate funding and more authority to take on the role of civil space traffic management, relieving the Defense Department of the job of warning commercial and non-US operators of potential on-orbit collisions, including with debris.\nIndeed, President Joe Biden’s nominee for DoD assistant secretary of space policy, John Plumb,in his confirmation hearing Thursday,called space traffic management “absolutely essential” and pledged to help make the transfer of responsibility happen.\n", "中文原文": "华盛顿：沮丧的行业官员、科学家和专家正在推动美国政府承担起清理太空环境的责任--从联邦机构创建的Debris开始，其中一些可以追溯到太空时代的早期。“政府能做的最重要的事情之一是，近地轨道上28%的碎片是由美国政府制造的。你知道，这是赢得冷战的一部分。探索初创公司旅行者太空控股公司在轨服务副总裁乔纳森·戈夫（Jonathan Goff）周四在白宫科学技术政策办公室主办的一次市政厅式的太空碎片虚拟会议上表示：“像赢得冷战中制造的许多其他环境混乱一样，这一混乱也应该得到清理。”奥巴马政府时期五角大楼太空政策前负责人道格·洛弗罗（Doug Loverro）在会议上表示：“如果美国海军有一艘废弃的船只停在主权水域，造成安全隐患，海军将出去抓住那艘船……或者更有可能雇佣一家打捞公司……继续把那艘船带回岸上。”“这种责任对航海国家来说已经存在了几十年。我不知道为什么我们没有看到政府对他们今天在太空中被遗弃的船只和尸体负有同样的责任。“一些与会者表示，承担责任包括为新兴技术的进一步发展和在轨演示提供更多联邦政府资金，以帮助启动市场，为谨慎的投资者改善商业案例。洛韦罗补充说：“如果政府对此负责，并表示他们将为人们支付费用，让他们继续处理那些废弃的船只和那些废弃的（火箭）尸体，我们已经谈到的许多商业方面都将是清楚的。”几位与会者指出，国防部通过利用小企业创新研究/小企业技术转让赠款等资助机构，努力刺激所谓主动碎片清除领域的技术创新，作为包括国家海洋和大气管理局(NOAA)和美国航天局在内的其他机构效仿的模式。然而，与会者说，处理日益增长的碎片问题不仅需要资金，还需要建立一个机构协调中心或一个机构间小组来协调跨政府的行动。“逃避问题或拖延问题不再是一种选择。碎片清除初创公司Astroscale负责全球空间政策和政府关系的副总裁慈善机构·韦登（Charity Weeden）表示：“积极管理空间环境需要我们立即关注，政府的作用应该是在支持发展方面发挥领导作用--不仅仅是技术，还有财政激励和政策基础--以允许补救服务蓬勃发展。”“补救是一个跨部门的问题，”她补充道。“因此，需要一个最高级别的协调员，他可以考虑所有部门机构将参与的方面。我们认为美国宇航局最初是正确的地方，我们对其他选择持开放态度，并就此进行辩论。“两个小时的“倾听会”为行业代表、科学家和感兴趣的公众提供了一个机会，对白宫去年1月在特朗普政府执政末期发布的“国家轨道碎片研究和发展计划”[PDF]进行权衡。11月初，拜登政府宣布，OSTP将更新该计划，该计划被一些专家批评为只是吹捧对已经广泛理解的问题进行更多研究，并在年底前开启了公众评论期。该请求特别要求就“哪些研发领域是政府发起的倡议/协调的优先事项，学术界、非营利组织和行业行为者在处理这些行动中的作用，以及公共和私营部门行为者之间协调的潜在途径”提供投入。作为后续行动，12月17日，OSTP宣布[PDF]将举行两次市政厅类型的口头评论虚拟机会，具体如下：·1月。13、碎片调解：“主动或被动操纵碎片物体以减少或消除其对运行中的空间资产构成的风险。这可能包括从轨道上完全清除碎片，将碎片从对运行中的航天器构成高风险的轨道转移到风险较低的轨道，以及找到重新利用或回收现有碎片的方法。“·1月。20、碎片减缓：指“通过精心选择航天器和运载火箭的设计，限制新碎片的产生”。周四的会议有时类似于电视喜剧宋飞节庆祝活动的“发泄不满”，有时则演变成wha", "中文源标题": "工业界呼吁白宫“立即”采取行动清理太空垃圾", "英文整编": "On January 13th, at the virtual conference on space debris held by the White House, industry participants said that cleaning up space debris should be one of the most important issues for the US government.

The stored pictures will also include information and metadata deemed necessary or useful for their military usage in test and/or research activities.\nOnce established and fully accessible, the database can be used, for instance, for target recognition, the assessment and improvement of camouflage effectiveness, the testing and enhancement of sensors in different terrains, the generation of synthetic images or the support of modelling and simulation activities.\nThe exercise participants came from different expert communities with an interest in the ETDB, particularly scientists and technicians specialised in Optronics and Radar sensor design (including materials) and performance prediction, design, development and testing of new camouflage, visible and infrared signature and Radar Cross Section mitigation solutions. The future dataset can be employed by the Ministries of Defence of all participating Member States for R&T initiatives as well as for operational and training purposes. The multinational field trial was therefore an excellent opportunity for those experts to meet and explore potential cooperation opportunities among European defence test centres.\nThe event was organised in the framework of EDA’s Defence Test & Evaluation Base (DTEB) initiative, which was launched in 2010 to collect, share and harmonise defence test & evaluation standards and procedures at European level.

KIZILELMA means “red apple” in Turkish, but refers to an expression in Turkish mythology that symbolizes goals, ideas, or dreams that are far away, but whose attraction is greater the further away they are.\nSelcuk Bayraktar, Baykar’s Chief Technology Officer, also posted the photographs and noted that his company launched another brand-new product three and a half years after beginning manufacturing of Akinci UCAV.\nWith the 5th generation fighters, the world is witnessing the end of manned fighters. No new manned combat aircraft will be developed. Unmanned systems will increasingly become the strongest elements on the battlefield in the future.

The announcement came along with several surprising renderings showing the future Turkish TCG Anadolu helicopter landing dock. This was an unexpected development, as Baykar is reportedly working on the TB3 Bayraktar UCAV to be deployed aboard TCG Anadolu, and MIUS will be a second option for aircraft operations.\nAfter being removed from the F35 JSF project, the Turkish government decided to transform the future TCG Anadolu into a carrier ship for attack drones. In a March interview, SSB Head Ismail Demir stated that after the project is completed, between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 drones will be sent to Anadolu. After seven months, he disclosed in a TV interview that LHD Anadolu will house up to 80 drones.\nConsidering a future in which air combat will be dominated by unmanned technology, the “BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA” developed entirely within Turkish borders will certainly play an increasingly important role in the future.\nAccording to the information provided by the company, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be a force to be reckoned with, primarily due to its aggressive maneuverability and stealth capability against radar. In addition, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be able to take off and land on aircraft carriers with short runways and conduct missions with internally carried munitions.\nThe first BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA prototype will use a turbofan to fly at Mach 0.8 near the speed of sound; later prototypes will fly at supersonic speeds. A SATCOM antenna will enable autonomous control via satellite, and MIUS can remain airborne for up to 5 hours. The unmanned jet will have 6 tons of takeoff weight and up to 1500 kg payload capacity.\nBaykar Defense and Ukraine’s Ivchenko-Progress signed a contract for Bayraktar KIZILELMA to supply AI-322F turbofan engines for the unmanned jet during the Defense, Aerospace, and Defense Exhibition SAHA EXPO 2021, which was held in Istanbul from Nov. 10-13, 2021.\nBayraktar KIZILELMA will be equipped with an AESA radar developed by Turkey’s leading defence company Aselsan and will be capable of launching indigenous Bozdogan and Gokdogan air-to-air missiles.

A well-known example is superconductivity: below a critical temperature some metals and other substances conduct electric current without any losses. At even lower temperatures additional quantum-physical effects can occur, which are relevant for basic research as well as for applications in quantum technologies.\nHowever, to reach such temperatures—less than a thousandth of a degree above the absolute zero of 0 Kelvin, or -273.15 degrees Celsius—is exceedingly difficult. Physicists in the research group of Prof. Dr. Dominik Zumbühl at the University of Basel, together with colleagues at the VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland and at Lancaster University in England, have now set a new low-temperature record. Their results have just been published in Physical Review Research.\nCooling with magnetic fields\n\"Cooling a material down very strongly is not the only problem,\" explains Christian Scheller, a senior scientist in Zumbühl's laboratory. \"One also has to reliably measure those extremely low temperatures.\"\nIn their experiments, the researchers cooled a tiny electric circuit made of copper on a silicon chip by first exposing it to a strong magnetic field, then cooling it with a special fridge known as a cryostat and eventually ramping down the magnetic field slowly. In this way, the nuclear spins of the copper atoms in the chip were initially aligned like small magnets and effectively cooled down even further when, at the end, ramping down the magnetic field led to a decrease in their magnetic energy.\n\"We've been working with such techniques for a decade now, but so far the lowest temperatures that could be reached in this way were limited by the vibrations of the fridge,\" says Omid Sharifi Sedeh, who was involved in the experiments as a Ph.D. student.\nThose vibrations, which arise from the continuous compression and rarefaction of the cooling agent helium in a so-called \"dry\" cryostat, significantly heat up the chip. To avoid that, the researchers developed a new sample holder that is wired so strongly that the chip can be cooled to very low temperatures despite the vibrations.\nRobust thermometer\nTo accurately measure those temperatures, Zumbühl and his collaborators improved a special thermometer that is integrated into the circuit. The thermometer consists of copper islands that are connected by so-called tunnel junctions. Electrons can move through those junctions more or less easily depending on the temperature.\nThe physicists found a method to make the thermometer more robust against material defects and, at the same time, more temperature-sensitive. This allowed them, finally, to measure a temperature of just 220 millionths of a degree above absolute zero (220 micro Kelvin).\nIn the future, the Basel researchers want to use their method to lower the temperature by another factor of ten and, in the long run, also cool semiconductor materials. That will pave the way towards studies of new quantum effects and diverse applications, such as the optimization of qubits in quantum computers.\n", "中文原文": "当材料被冷却到极低的温度时，它们的行为往往与室温下的行为有很大的不同。一个众所周知的例子是超导电性：在临界温度以下，一些金属和其他物质传导电流而没有任何损耗。即使在更低的温度下，也会发生额外的量子物理效应，这与基础研究以及量子技术的应用有关。然而，要达到这样的温度--比绝对零度0开尔文或零下273.15摄氏度高出不到千分之一摄氏度--是极其困难的。巴塞尔大学Dominik Zumbühl教授研究组的物理学家，以及芬兰VTT技术研究中心和英国兰卡斯特大学的同事，现在创造了一项新的低温记录。他们的结果刚刚发表在《物理评论研究》上。磁场冷却Zumbühl实验室的高级科学家Christian Scheller解释说：“非常强烈地冷却材料并不是唯一的问题。”“人们还必须可靠地测量这些极低的温度.”在他们的实验中，研究人员首先将一个由铜制成的硅芯片上的微小电路暴露在强磁场中，然后用一个被称为低温恒温器的特殊冰箱冷却，最后慢慢降低磁场，以此来冷却它。通过这种方式，芯片中铜原子的核自旋最初像小磁铁一样排列，当最后磁场下降导致它们的磁能下降时，有效地进一步冷却。“我们已经研究这种技术十年了，但到目前为止，这种方式可以达到的最低温度受到冰箱振动的限制，”奥米德·沙里菲·塞德说，他作为一名博士生参与了这项实验。这些振动是由冷却介质氦在所谓的“干燥”低温恒温器中的持续压缩和稀薄引起的，它显著地加热了芯片。为了避免这种情况，研究人员开发了一种新的样品支架，这种支架连接得非常牢固，即使有振动，芯片也可以被冷却到非常低的温度。鲁棒温度计为了精确测量这些温度，Zumbühl和他的合作者改进了一种集成在电路中的特殊温度计。温度计由铜岛组成，这些铜岛通过所谓的隧道结连接起来。电子可以或多或少地通过这些结，这取决于温度。物理学家们发现了一种方法，使温度计对材料缺陷更加坚固，同时对温度更加敏感。这使得他们最终能够测量到绝对零度以上220百万分之一度（220微开尔文）的温度。在未来，巴塞尔的研究人员希望用他们的方法将温度降低10倍，从长远来看，也可以冷却半导体材料。这将为研究新的量子效应和各种应用铺平道路，如量子计算机中量子比特的优化。", "中文源标题": "发展中的超冷电路：物理学家建立了一种新型的金属箔封装的低温记录光阴极", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers in University of Basel, Switzerland have set a new record for low temperature work of ultra-low temperature integrated circuits.

It is expected to become the world’s most powerful rocket-ship. “Starship was designed from the onset to be able to carry more than 100 tons of cargo to Mars and the Moon. The cargo version can also be used for rapid point-to-point Earth transport. Various payload bay configurations are available and allow for fully autonomous deployment of cargo to Earth, Lunar, or Martian surfaces,” the company said.\nSpaceX’s Starship launch vehicle has many potential uses and capabilities that will enable access to space like never before. The cargo version of Starship will be able to launch entire satellite constellations in a single launch inside its payload bay. For perspective, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 can carry up to 60 Starlink satellites in a tight configuration inside its 5.2-meter diameter fairing, Starship will be able to carry 400 Starlink satellites to deploy in a single launch inside its fairing. Starship will be capable of deploying giant spacecraft to space inside its clamshell-like fairing, which has an outer diameter of 9-meters –“the largest usable payload volume of any current or in development launcher,” the company says. SpaceX also plans to design an extended Starship volume capability for payloads requiring up to 22-meters of height.\nStarship will also be able to capture satellites already in orbit to be repaired or brought back to be disposed of on Earth, according to SpaceX’s Starship User Guide. “Fully-reusable Starship and Super Heavy systems are expected to allow for space-based activities that have not been possible since the retirement of the Space Shuttle and Space Transportation System, or have never been possible before. With a fully reusable Starship, satellites can be captured and repaired in Orbit, returned to Earth, or transferred to a new operational orbit,” SpaceX’s vehicle guide says. This will be possible with Starship’s large clamshell-like cargo door mechanism that opens and closes, as shown in the image below. The clamshell door can be modified to “chomp up” old satellites and space junk orbiting Earth. “We can fly Starship around space and chomp up debris with the moving fairing door,” SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in July 2021.\nThis clamshell-like fairing could enable engineers to develop a mechanism to gather satellites to repair, as well as pick up other orbiting objects that are no longer in use. SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell says Starship could help clean up space. “Starship is an extraordinary new vehicle capability… Not only will it decrease the costs of access to space, it’s the vehicle that would transport people from Earth to Mars,” Shotwell said last year, “But it also has the capability of taking cargo and crew at the same time, and so it’s quite possible that we could leverage Starship to go to some of these dead rocket bodies — other people’s rocket’s, of course.

Scientists are therefore drawing on how the brain and its interconnected neurons function for inspiration in designing innovative computing technologies. They foresee that these brain-inspired computing systems, will be more energy-efficient than conventional ones, as well as better at performing machine-learning tasks.\nMuch like neurons, which are responsible for both data storage and data processing in the brain, scientists want to combine storage and processing in a single type of electronic component, known as a memristor. Their hope is that this will help to achieve greater efficiency because moving data between the processor and the storage, as conventional computers do, is the main reason for the high energy consumption in machine-learning applications.\nResearchers at ETH Zurich, Empa and the University of Zurich have now developed an innovative concept for a memristor that can be used in a far wider range of applications than existing memristors. \"There are different operation modes for memristors, and it is advantageous to be able to use all these modes depending on an artificial neural network's architecture,\" explains ETH Zurich postdoc Rohit John. \"But previous conventional memristors had to be configured for one of these modes in advance.\" The new memristors can now easily switch between two operation modes while in use: a mode in which the signal grows weaker over time and dies (volatile mode), and one in which the signal remains constant (non-volatile mode).\nJust like in the brain\n\"These two operation modes are also found in the human brain,\" John says. On the one hand, stimuli at the synapses are transmitted from neuron to neuron with biochemical neurotransmitters. These stimuli start out strong and then gradually become weaker. On the other hand, new synaptic connections to other neurons form in the brain while we learn. These connections are longer-lasting.\nJohn, who is a postdoc in the group headed by ETH Zurich/Empa researcher Maksym Kovalenko, was awarded an ETH fellowship for outstanding postdoctoral researchers in 2020. John conducted this research together with Yi?it Demira?, a doctoral student in Giacomo Indiveri's group at the Institute for Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.\nSemiconductor material known from solar cells\nThe memristors the researchers have developed are made of halide perovskite nanocrystals, a semiconductor material known primarily from its use in photovoltaic cells. \"The 'nerve conduction' in these new memristors is mediated by temporarily or permanently stringing together silver ions from an electrode to form a nanofilament penetrating the perovskite structure through which current can flow,\" explains Kovalenko.\nThis process can be regulated to make the silver-ion filament either thin, so that it gradually breaks back down into individual silver ions (volatile mode), or thick and permanent (non-volatile mode). This is controlled by the intensity of the current conducted on the memristor: Applying a weak current activates the volatile mode, while a strong current activates the non-volatile mode.\nNew toolkit for neuroinformaticians\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first memristor that can be reliably switched between volatile and non-volatile modes on demand,\" Demira? says. This means that in the future, computer chips can be manufactured with memristors that enable both modes. This is a significance advance because it is usually not possible to combine several different types of memristors on one chip.\nWithin the scope of the study, which they recently published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers tested 25 of these new memristors and carried out 20,000 measurements with them. In this way, they were able to simulate a computational problem on a complex network. The problem involved classifying a number of different neuron spikes as one of four predefined patterns.\nBefore these memristors can be used in computer technology, they will need to undergo further optimization. However, such components are also important for research in neuroinformatics, as Indiveri points out: \"These components come closer to real neurons than previous ones. As a result, they help researchers to better test hypotheses in neuroinformatics and hopefully gain a better understanding of the computing principles of real neuronal circuits in humans and animals.\"\n", "中文原文": "与计算机相比，人脑的能源效率高得令人难以置信。因此，科学家们正在研究大脑及其相互连接的神经元的功能，以获得设计创新计算技术的灵感。他们预计，这些受大脑启发的计算系统将比传统的系统更节能，也更擅长执行机器学习任务。就像大脑中负责数据存储和数据处理的神经元一样，科学家们希望将存储和处理结合在一种单一类型的电子元件中，即忆阻器。他们希望这将有助于实现更高的效率，因为像传统计算机一样，在处理器和存储器之间移动数据是机器学习应用中高能耗的主要原因。苏黎世ETH,Empa和苏黎世大学的研究人员现在开发了一种创新的忆阻器概念，该概念可以用于比现有忆阻器更广泛的应用领域。苏黎世ETH博士后Rohit John解释说：“忆阻器有不同的工作模式，根据人工神经网络的架构，能够使用所有这些模式是有利的。”“但是以前的传统忆阻器必须预先为这些模式之一配置.”新的忆阻器现在可以在使用时轻松地在两种工作模式之间切换：一种是信号随时间变弱并消失的模式（易失性模式），另一种是信号保持不变的模式（非易失性模式）。就像在大脑里一样“这两种操作模式也存在于人脑中，”约翰说。一方面，突触上的刺激通过生化神经递质在神经元之间传递。这些刺激开始时很强，然后逐渐变弱。另一方面，当我们学习时，大脑中与其他神经元形成新的突触连接。这些联系更为持久。约翰是ETH苏黎世/Empa研究员马克西姆·科瓦连科（Maksym Kovalenko）领导的研究组的博士后，他在2020年获得了ETH杰出博士后研究员奖学金。约翰与苏黎世大学和苏黎世联邦理工学院神经信息学研究所Giacomo Indiveri小组的博士生Yi？it Demira一起进行了这项研究。已知太阳能电池的半导体材料研究人员开发的忆阻器是由卤化物钙钛矿纳米晶体制成的，这是一种半导体材料，主要是从它在光伏电池中的应用中得知的。科瓦连科解释说：“这些新型忆阻器中的‘神经传导’是通过暂时或永久地将电极上的银离子串在一起，形成穿透钙钛矿结构的纳米丝来介导的，电流可以通过这种结构流动。”这一过程可以被调节，使银离子丝要么变薄，使其逐渐分解成单个银离子（挥发性模式），要么变粗并永久（非挥发性模式）。这是由传导在忆阻器上的电流强度控制的：施加弱电流激活易失性模式，而施加强电流激活非易失性模式。神经信息学家的新工具包“据我们所知，这是第一个可以根据需要在易失性和非易失性模式之间可靠切换的忆阻器，”德米拉？说。这意味着，在未来，计算机芯片可以制造与忆阻器，使两种模式。这是一个重要的进步，因为通常不可能在一个芯片上组合几种不同类型的忆阻器。在最近发表在《自然通讯》杂志上的这项研究范围内，研究人员测试了25个这种新型忆阻器，并用它们进行了2万次测量。这样，他们就能够在一个复杂的网络上模拟一个计算问题。这个问题涉及到将许多不同的神经元尖峰分类为四种预定义模式之一。在这些忆阻器可以用于计算机技术之前，它们将需要经过进一步的优化。然而，这样的组件对于神经信息学的研究也很重要，正如Indiveri所指出的：“这些组件比以前的更接近真实的神经元。因此，它们帮助研究人员更好地检验神经信息学的假设，并有望更好地理解人类和动物真实神经元回路的计算原理。”", "中文源标题": "基于钙钛矿纳米晶的双模忆阻器：一种用于脑启发计算的组件", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland have developed a new type of memristor.

A company-owned Avenger? Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was paired with “digital twin” aircraft to autonomously conduct Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) multi-objective collaborative combat missions. The flights, which took place on Dec. 14, 2022, from GA-ASI’s Desert Horizons flight operations facility in El Mirage, Calif., demonstrate the company’s commitment to maturing its CCA ecosystem for Autonomous Collaborative Platform (ACP) UAS using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This provides a new and innovative tool for next-generation military platforms to make decisions under dynamic and uncertain real-world conditions.\nThe flight used GA-ASI’s novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture built using agile software development methodology and industry-standard tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to develop and validate three deep learning RL algorithms in an operationally relevant environment. RL agents demonstrated single, multi, and hierarchical agent behaviors. The single agent RL model successfully navigated the live plane while dynamically avoiding threats to accomplish its mission. Multi-agent RL models flew a live and virtual Avenger to collaboratively chase a target while avoiding threats. The hierarchical RL agent used sensor information to select courses of action based on its understanding of the world state. This demonstrated the AI pilot’s ability to successfully process and act on live real-time information independently of a human operator to make mission-critical decisions at the speed of relevance.\nFor the missions, real-time updates were made to flight paths based on fused sensor tracks provided by virtual Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) models, and RL agent missions were dynamically selected by operators while the plane was airborne, demonstrating live, effective human-machine teaming for autonomy. This live operational data describing AI pilot performance will be fed into GA-ASI’s rapid retraining process for analysis and used to refine future agent performance.\n“The concepts demonstrated by these flights set the standard for operationally relevant mission systems capabilities on CCA platforms,” said GA-ASI Senior Director of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. “The combination of airborne high-performance computing, sensor fusion, human-machine teaming, and AI pilots making decisions at the speed of relevance shows how quickly GA-ASI’s capabilities are maturing as we move to operationalize autonomy for CCAs.”\nThe team used a government-furnished Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) autonomy engine and the government-standard OMS messaging protocol to enable communication between the RL agents and the LVC system. Utilizing government standards such as OMS will make rapid integration of autonomy for CCAs possible.\nIn addition, GA-ASI used a General Dynamics Mission Systems’ EMC2 to run the autonomy architecture.

The project concludes aviation can achieve net zero 2050 through the development of both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green liquid hydrogen technologies.\nTo secure market share on new hydrogen-powered aircraft, UK companies must be ready to demonstrate technologies by 2025. This timescale is key for new zero-carbon emission aircraft to enter service by 2035 and to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nLed by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and backed by the UK government, FlyZero has concluded that green liquid hydrogen is the optimum fuel for zero-carbon emission flight and could power a midsize aircraft with 280 passengers from London to San Francisco directly, or from London to Auckland with just one stop.\nIntroducing a midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 and a narrowbody aircraft by 2037 represents the greatest opportunity for reducing carbon emissions and maximising market impact. Aviation’s carbon emissions would reduce by four gigatons (Gt) up to 2050, equivalent to four years’ of total global aviation carbon emissions, if half the commercial fleet were hydrogen-powered by then, and 14 Gt by 2060.\nThe UK can build on decades of expertise in aerospace innovation to propel a new generation of liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft into our skies, working with global OEMs, governments, and regulatory bodies. With targeted investment in technology, the UK could grow its market share in civil aerospace from 12% today to 19% by 2050, increasing the sector’s gross value added to the economy from ?11bn to ?36bn and the number of aerospace jobs from 116,000 to 154,000.\nThe report sets out how aviation can keep businesses, cultures, families and nations connected without the carbon footprint. Realising this presents challenges for all facets of our aerospace and aviation sectors as well as wider industries and energy infrastructure. An integrated, collaborative, international approach to these challenges is needed to protect our planet, maintain the benefits of aviation and secure economic growth.\nIn parallel, the UK must also continue to advance technologies required for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as both SAF and liquid hydrogen are needed to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nChris Gear, project director said: “Zero-carbon emission flight can be a reality. Tackling the challenge of our generation requires accelerated technology development and urgent investment in green energy together with regulatory and infrastructure changes.\n“The next three years are crucial to develop the technologies, build our skills in liquid hydrogen and demonstrate capability here in the UK to enable our aerospace sector and supply chain to secure its role in a new era for aviation.\n“Realising hydrogen powered flight by 2035 is a huge challenge but is essential if we are to maintain the social and economic benefits of air travel while protecting our planet and meeting our commitments to fight climate change.”\nIndustry Minister Lee Rowley said: “Realising zero carbon flight is one of the most ambitious challenges we can contemplate. However, it could also be one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK’s world leading aerospace sector.\n“It’s great to see FlyZero’s final outputs following a year of intense research, successfully bringing UK industry together to think through how to reduce aviation’s impact on our Earth and sky while ensuring and celebrating the immense benefits of air travel and connecting the world.”.\nThe report published today summarises FlyZero’s findings in a range of key areas:\nTechnology – revolutionary technology breakthroughs are required in six areas to achieve zero-carbon emission flight: hydrogen fuel systems and tanks, hydrogen gas turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, electrical propulsion systems, aerodynamic structures and thermal management. The UK has expertise and capability today in these, but little in liquid hydrogen fuels.\nCarbon emissions – global cumulative CO2 emissions from aviation could be reduced by 4 gigatons (Gt) by 2050 and 14 Gt by 2060. This requires 50% of the commercial fleet to be hydrogen-powered by 2050 and assumes midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft are operating by 2035, with hydrogen-powered narrowbody aircraft in service by 2037.\nNon-CO2 emissions – burning hydrogen in a gas turbine emits no CO2 or SOx but water emissions are over 2.5 times higher than for fossil fuel-powered aircraft. Particulate matter will largely be eliminated, and it is estimated that NOx emissions will be reduced by 50 to 70%.\nSustainability – developing a new generation of aircraft presents an opportunity to integrate sustainability into design and manufacture, and further improve the reuse of materials.\nEconomics – from the mid-2030s liquid hydrogen will be cheaper than the most widely available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), power-to-liquid.\nMarket impact – the optimum route to decarbonising aviation is through the accelerated introduction into service of a large commercial aircraft similar to FlyZero’s midsize concept which is capable of reaching anywhere in the world with just one stop. Less commercially risky than developing a narrowbody first, this midsize first approach would also allow infrastructure development to be focused on fewer, but larger international hub airports.\nInfrastructure and operations – generating the quantity of hydrogen needed for aviation will require unprecedented renewable energy capacity. Transporting hydrogen to airports will require gaseous pipelines or liquid hydrogen tanker deliveries, while refuelling aircraft will require larger diameter hoses and increased automation to ensure it can take place safely and efficiently alongside other aircraft.\nResearch – the UK requires a hydrogen research and development facility with open access for academia and a range of industries including aerospace, automotive, marine, space and energy.\nClimate science – research into the climate impact of emissions from hydrogen gas turbines including through modelling and testing is fundamental alongside the technology development.\nThe FlyZero project is publishing its detailed conclusions through a series of reports which explore the technology challenges, manufacturing demands, operational requirements, market opportunity and sustainability credentials of zero-carbon emission commercial aircraft. A series of more detailed and technical reports together with new supporting research from industry and academia are also available to organisations that meet the requirements of an access test. For a full list of reports and information on how to access them, visit ati.org.uk/flyzero-reports.\nThe FlyZero project has made some initial conclusions that require further investigation and investment to understand the feasibility and approach to innovation for the next phase. To this end the ATI will incorporate the findings from the project into its forthcoming technology and portfolio strategies and look to pursue opportunities for the UK.\n", "中文原文": "英国对零碳排放商业航空旅行的研究FlyZero公布了新一代液氢动力飞机的愿景，今天3月17日星期四。《我们对零碳排放航空旅行的愿景》报告标志着一项为期12个月的研究的结论，该研究旨在考虑零碳排放飞机的可行性。该项目得出结论，通过发展可持续航空燃料(SAF)和绿色液氢技术，航空可以在2050年实现净零排放。为了确保新氢动力飞机的市场份额，英国公司必须准备好在2025年前展示技术。这一时间表是新零碳排放飞机到2035年服役和实现2050年净零排放目标的关键。由航空航天技术研究所(ATI)领导并得到英国政府支持的FlyZero得出结论，绿色液氢是零碳排放飞行的最佳燃料，可以为一架载有280名乘客的中型飞机提供动力，从伦敦直接飞往旧金山，或者从伦敦飞往奥克兰只需一站。到2035年推出中型氢动力飞机，到2037年推出窄体飞机，这是减少碳排放和最大限度扩大市场影响的最大机会。到2050年，航空业的碳排放将减少4千兆吨，相当于全球航空业四年的碳排放总量，如果到那时一半的商业机队是氢动力的，到2060年是14兆吨。英国可以利用几十年来在航空航天创新方面的专业知识，与全球原始设备制造商、政府和监管机构合作，推动新一代液氢动力飞机进入我们的天空。通过有针对性的技术投资，到2050年，英国在民用航天领域的市场份额可能从目前的12%增长到19%，使该行业对经济的增加值总额从110亿英镑增加到360亿英镑，航空航天就业岗位从11.6万个增加到15.4万个。该报告阐述了航空如何在没有碳足迹的情况下保持企业、文化、家庭和国家之间的联系。意识到这一点对我们航天和航空部门以及更广泛的工业和能源基础设施的各个方面都提出了挑战。为了保护我们的地球，保持航空的好处，确保经济增长，需要采取综合、协作和国际办法来应对这些挑战。与此同时，英国还必须继续推进可持续航空燃料(SAF)所需的技术，因为实现2050年净零目标需要SAF和液氢。项目主任克里斯·吉尔说：“零碳排放飞行可以成为现实。应对我们这一代人的挑战需要加速技术开发和对绿色能源的紧急投资，同时进行监管和基础设施改革。“未来三年对开发技术、培养我们在液氢方面的技能和在英国展示能力至关重要，以使我们的航空航天部门和供应链能够确保在航空新时代发挥作用。“到2035年实现氢动力飞行是一个巨大的挑战，但如果我们要在保护我们的地球和履行我们应对气候变化的承诺的同时保持航空旅行的社会和经济效益，这是至关重要的。”工业部长李·罗利说：“实现零碳飞行是我们能想到的最雄心勃勃的挑战之一。然而，这也可能是英国世界领先的航空航天行业最大的经济机遇之一。“很高兴看到FlyZero在经过一年的紧张研究后的最终成果，成功地将英国行业聚集在一起，思考如何减少航空对我们地球和天空的影响，同时确保和庆祝航空旅行的巨大好处，并连接世界。”。今天发表的报告总结了FlyZero在一系列关键领域的发现：技术--实现零碳排放飞行需要在六个领域取得革命性技术突破：氢燃料系统和贮箱、氢燃气轮机、氢燃料电池、电力推进系统、气动结构和热管理。英国今天在这些方面有专业知识和能力，但在液氢燃料方面很少。碳排放--到2050年，全球航空累计二氧化碳排放量可减少4千吨(Gt)，到2060年可减少14千吨(Gt)。这要求到2050年50%的商业机队使用氢动力，并假设到2035年中型氢动力飞机投入运营，到2037年氢动力窄体飞机投入使用。非二氧化碳排放--在燃气轮机中燃烧氢气不会排放二氧化碳或SOx，但水的排放比化石燃料飞机高2.5倍以上。颗粒物将在很大程度上被消除，预计NOx排放量将减少50%至70%。可持续发展-开发新一代飞机提供了整合可持续发展的机会", "中文源标题": "到2025年，第一代零碳排放飞机需要氢技术", "英文整编": "On the same day, the British Institute of Aerospace Technology (ATI) announced that its FlyZero project had completed its 12-month preliminary research, and released a report entitled \"Our Vision for Zero-Carbon Emission Air Travel\", which showed the vision for a new generation of liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft, which aims to explore the feasibility of zero-carbon aircraft.The FlyZero project team brings together 100 experts from Airbus, Rollo, GKN Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems, General Aviation, Reaction Engines, NATS, EasyJet and Eaton. By comparing zero-carbon emission energy sources such as batteries, hydrogen and ammonia, it is concluded that green liquid hydrogen is the most feasible and has the potential to be extended to large aircraft using fuel cells, gas turbines and hybrid propulsion systems. In order for the aviation industry to achieve the net zero goal in 2050, it is necessary to invest in the development of sustainable aviation fuels and green liquid hydrogen technology. In order to ensure the market share of new hydrogen-powered aircraft, British companies must be ready for technology demonstration before 2025, which is very important for the new zero-carbon aircraft to be put into use in 2035 and achieve the goal of net zero emissions in 2050.Introducing a medium-sized hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 and a narrow-body aircraft by 2037 is an important opportunity to reduce carbon emissions and maximize market influence. By 2050, the carbon emissions of aviation industry will be reduced by 4 billion tons, which is equivalent to the emissions of global aviation industry for 4 years. If half of commercial aircraft use hydrogen fuel by then, the emissions will be reduced by 14 billion tons by 2060. Britain can use decades of expertise in aerospace innovation to cooperate with global aviation equipment manufacturers, governments and regulators to promote the research and development and practical application of a new generation of liquid hydrogen powered aircraft. Through targeted technology investment, by 2050, the UK's market share in civil aviation will increase from 12% now to 19%, the economic value added of the industry will increase from 11 billion pounds to 36 billion pounds, and the number of aviation jobs will increase from 11. 60,000 to 15. 40,000. Technology acceleration is the key, and the industry and aviation industry can only provide one fleet update by 2050. This provides an opportunity to introduce zero-carbon aircraft in regional aircraft, narrow-body aircraft and medium-sized aircraft markets. FlyZero has modeled these concepts and determined that it is feasible to design and fly an experimental aircraft driven by hydrogen turbines across the Atlantic by 2030. The following summarizes a series of key area findings in the FlyZero project report:? Technology-Achieving zero-carbon flight requires revolutionary technological breakthroughs in the following six areas: hydrogen fuel systems and storage tanks, hydrogen gas turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, electric propulsion systems, aerodynamic structures and thermal management. In several aspects, Britain's professional ability in liquid hydrogen fuel is relatively weak at present.? Carbon emissions-By 2050, the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions of the global aviation industry will be reduced by 4 billion tons, and by 2060, it will be reduced by 14 billion tons. This requires 50% of commercial aircraft to be hydrogen-powered by 2050, and medium-sized hydrogen-powered aircraft to be put into use by 2035 and narrow-body hydrogen-powered aircraft to be put into use by 2037.? Non-CO2 emissions-Combustion of hydrogen in gas turbines does not produce CO2 or sulfur oxides, but water emissions are 2. 5% of those of fossil fuel-powered aircraft. More than 5 times. Particulate matter will be basically eliminated, and the emission of nitrogen oxides is expected to be reduced by 50 ~ 70%.? Sustainability-The development of a new generation of aircraft will pay more attention to the sustainability of design and manufacture, and further improve the reuse of materials.? Economy-From the mid-2030s, liquid hydrogen will be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the most widely used sustainable aviation fuels.? Market impact-The best way to decarbonize aviation is to accelerate the introduction of commercial aircraft (such as FlyZero's medium-sized concept aircraft), which can reach anywhere in the world in just one stop. Compared with the previous development of narrow-body aircraft, this medium-sized aircraft has less commercial risks, and can concentrate infrastructure development on a small number of larger international hub airports.? Infrastructure and operations-Producing the amount of hydrogen needed by the aviation industry will require unprecedented renewable energy capacity. Transporting hydrogen to the airport will require gas pipelines or liquid hydrogen tankers, while hydrogenation facilities will require larger diameter hoses and a higher degree of automation to ensure that it can operate safely and efficiently with other aircraft.? Research-Britain currently needs a hydrogen energy research and development institution, which is open to academia and a series of industries including aerospace, automobile, ocean, space and energy.? Climate science-study the impact of hydrogen turbine emissions on climate, and carry out a series of modeling and testing, which is also the basic content of this technology development."}, {"中文标题": "美国和以色列企业联合为美军开发微型巡飞弹", "情报来源": "荷兰航天防务新闻网站", "时间": "2022年10月7日", "整编内容": "美国莱昂纳多DRS公司近日宣布已与以色列斯皮尔无人机公司（SpearUAV）签订协议，将为美国市场开发一种微型“蝰蛇”巡飞弹（VIPER）。斯皮尔公司吸取最近重大冲突中的经验教训，迅速开发出了一款垂直发射的四旋翼巡飞弹“蝰蛇”，旨在为作战人员提供成本低廉、简单高效的弹药来打击包括遮蔽目标在内的各种目标。“蝰蛇”可为班组级部队提供有组织的、反应迅速的精确火力，使操作人员能在不依赖更高级别资源的情况下摧毁敌人狙击手和火箭推进榴弹（RPG）小组等直接威胁。此外，“蝰蛇”的精度还可以将复杂城市地形的附带伤害降至最低。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中国电科", "源网址": "https://www.asdnews.com/news/defense/2022/10/07/leonardo-drs-teams-with-spearuav-ltd-nanoscale-aerial-munitions#:~:text=Oct%207%2C%202022%20Leonardo%20DRS%20Teams%20with%20SpearUAV,VIPER%20nano-scale%20aerial%20munition%20for%20the%20US%20market.", "源标题": "Leonardo DRS Teams with SpearUAV Ltd for Nano-scale Aerial Munitions", "原文": "Leonardo DRS, Inc.

Those technologies that don’t have a big impact on the outcome will either be dropped or sent back a few steps for refinement, she said.\nShyu is also looking for asymmetric countermeasures that can offset adversary strengths, about which she didn’t elaborate.\n“Our decisions and investments ought to be driven by exquisite modeling/simulation” at the campaign level, which offers excursions on new capabilities for both the Red and Blue forces, she said.\n“We can literally play it out,” she said. “Let’s go through this battle and see what happens.”\nIf a technology plugged into the game “doesn’t really change the outcome, do I really need this? Should I spend my money somewhere else? Where I can get a bigger bang for the buck?”\nShe said this approach is being taken for a number of new capabilities among her 14 technology priorities. A specific one is looking at many variations of the nuclear command and control system.\n“This is how we get rapid experimentation capabilities proven in a contested environment,” she said. Sometimes, “a great widget works fabulously inside your lab, but when you get it out to the real environment, all the pitfalls show up.”\nThe results of these exercises, along with her office’s notes, are providing insights to help the Joint Staff and regional combatant commanders set their priorities for what they want the R&E enterprise to focus on.\nShyu declined to pick the most important or highest-priority areas under her 14 areas, saying that’s like a parent choosing a favorite child. “They’re all beautiful,” she said.\nThe 14 areas laid out in a February memo from Shyu include ”seed areas” such as biotechnology, future wireless technology, quantum science, and advanced materials. Under “effective adoption areas,” Shyu listed technologies already available in the commercial market which can be integrated into defense systems. These include artificial intelligence and autonomy, human-machine teaming, advanced computing, microelectronics, space technology, renewable energy, and energy storage.\nA third grouping identified as “defense-specific” includes hypersonics, directed-energy weapons, integrated sensing systems, and cyber warfare.\nIn her February memo listing the 14 focus areas, Shyu said she will rapidly protype systems that employ these capabilities and develop “continuous campaigns of Joint experimentation” to refine and deliver the new capabilities.\nShyu said her office will release an “unclassified volume” describing the technology foundations of the National Defense Strategy, “so the public has visibility into these technology areas that are priorities.” Industry may also be able to see a classified version “to give you a little more context about why” certain technologies are priorities and others aren’t, she said. It will contain “a rationale you won’t see in the unclassified” version.\nShyu said she’s anxious to “transition” new technologies into the hands of operators. But “everyone has a different definition of ‘transition,’” she said. The obvious one is when an “advanced prototype” turns into a program of record, but “it could be a piece of software that got into the hands of a warfighter … It could be something dual-use, and we decide to go commercial. That’s a successful transition: We funded it; it went commercial; we’re buying it off the shelf.”\nShyu also said she is making more efficient use of technology funds. New data systems are giving her insight into the technology programs across the breadth of the Pentagon’s science and technology and R&D enterprise at a level of detail not previously available, “and we’re sharing that with industry.” She said she has monthly meetings with small and large companies, looking for feedback on the “pain points” of working the Pentagon S&T enterprise.\nHer shop is also focusing on international engagements, sharing information that can help avoid duplication of effort and yield results that both parties can use. As an example, she cited the SCIFIRE air-breathing hypersonics initiative with Australia, which she said helped the Air Force makes its downselect for the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.\n“Every single novel idea was not invented here, right?” Shyu said, adding that she wants to “look wide” at partner and ally technologies, in an application of “integrated deterrence,” to “collaborate together to counter our adversary.” She said she’s created a “SAP umbrella”—meaning special access programs information sharing agreement—“to share more sensitive information” in pursuit of co-development.\nShe noted that President Biden “made the decision to share exquisite [intelligence] data with NATO. That built trust. Because they realized” what the U.S. said it was seeing “all … came true,” and that built trust to work better together.\n“I want to share development with partner nations,” she asserted, naming “Australia, the UK, NATO, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Latvia … Israel, you name it” who “all want to be partners with us, [who are] interested in co-development.”\nShe’s particularly interested in “leap ahead” technologies that can asymmetrically blunt certain threats, which will be important for the “campaigning” aspect of the NDS’s integrated deterrence mantra, Shyu said.\n“Just because you have 1,000 tanks, if I have 1,001, I win … that’s very linear thinking. I want to think about what are the asymmetric ways we can counter the threat,” she said.\nTo that end, she’s setting up a “war room” that will focus all available “intel threat” intelligence, along with the state-of-the-art of technology and the status of technology efforts underway in the DOD, so that “we can get to … the asymmetric things we’re developing, faster.”\n“So that the ‘war room,’ and I want to use that to drive the S&T strategy,” she said. It will look at the enterprise “cohesively. And it’s going to cover underwater to space.”\nShyu said she’s had “a very significant impact on the POM,” or five-year spending plan, and that’s because she has regular engagement with the regional commanders and understand their needs for “what we need to be ready in the 10-20-30 year timeframe” as well as in the short term.\nThe acquisition system needs to move faster, Shyu said, and have more flexibility. China, she said, doesn’t suffer from the protracted process of funding requests, approvals, and oversight, and this allows them to obtain new technology faster.\n“Our budget process is a two-year process … and you have to have exquisite knowledge of what you need … five years into the future,” Shyu said, which is “crazy because threats may pop up that you didn’t anticipate.”\n“Right now, we have a problem: You did [research, development, test and evaluation]. Now, did you POM [submit a long-term plan] for the procurement money? If you didn’t … then it’s a year you’re sitting there waiting for the procurement money.”\nShyu asked, “Why would you do things like this to yourself? Right? Money is money.”\nShe said the Pentagon needs “a lot more flexibility to be able to pivot. It’s a rigid structure to which we shackle ourselves, like tying our shoelaces together and trying to run.” It would be a big help to “give us some colorless money, as well,” she said, referring to funding accounts that can only be used for certain kinds of technology efforts, often referred to as the “color of money” problem.\nAsked about friction in the breakup of the position of undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics into two jobs—hers, and that of theUSD for acquisition and sustainment, William A. LaPlante—Shyu said the friction is largely erased because of their working relationship.\nWhen Shyu was acquisition executive for the Army, LaPlante was the acquisition executive for the Air Force, and they have a solid partnership, she said.\nIf there’s a problem between the two enterprises, “it gets escalated up to us … and we fix it in five minutes. We trust each other,” she said. This “sets the example” for the two organizations to be collaborative, she said.\n", "中文原文": "2022年11月8日，约翰·蒂尔帕克负责研究和工程的国防部副部长Heidi Shu说，战争游戏的结果和不对称对抗对手的机会正在推动五角大楼对新技术的投资选择。她还表示，一份概述支撑新国防战略的科学和技术的非机密文件将于春季公布。在11月3日由乔治·梅森大学主办的一次以收购为主题的活动中，Shu说，她选择投资一些技术，这些技术被证明对大型战争游戏的结果产生了重大影响，这些战争游戏源于国防高级研究计划局（Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency）开发的游戏系统。她说，那些对结果没有太大影响的技术要么被放弃，要么被退回几步进行改进。Shyu还在寻找可以抵消对手优势的非对称对策，对此她没有详细说明。她说，“我们的决定和投资应该由精巧的建模/仿真驱动”，这为红蓝部队提供了新能力的考察。“我们真的可以把它发挥出来，”她说。“让我们经历这场战斗，看看会发生什么。”如果插入游戏的技术“并没有真正改变结果，我真的需要这个吗？我应该把钱花在别的地方吗？在哪里我可以用钱得到更大的爆炸？“她说，在她的14项技术优先事项中，许多新功能正在采取这种方法。一个具体的研究是核指挥和控制系统的许多变化。“这就是我们如何在有争议的环境中获得快速实验能力的证明，”她说。有时，“一个很棒的小部件在你的实验室里工作得非常好，但是当你把它放到真实的环境中时，所有的陷阱都显现出来了。”这些演习的结果，以及她的办公室的说明，提供了深刻的见解，以帮助联合参谋部和地区战斗指挥官确定他们希望R&E企业关注的优先事项。Shyu拒绝在她的14个领域中选择最重要或最优先的领域，她说这就像父母选择最喜欢的孩子一样。“它们都很漂亮，”她说。Shyu在2月份的备忘录中列出的14个领域包括“种子领域”，如生物技术、未来无线技术、量子科学和先进材料。在“有效采用领域”下，Shyu列出了商业市场上已经可以集成到防御系统中的技术。其中包括人工智能和自主、人机协同、先进计算、微电子、空间技术、可再生能源和能源存储。第三类被确定为“防御专用”包括高超音速、定向能武器、综合传感系统和网络战。在2月份列出14个重点领域的备忘录中，Shu表示，她将迅速开发使用这些功能的系统，并开发“持续的联合实验活动”，以完善和交付新功能。Shyu说，她的办公室将发布一份“非机密卷”，描述国防战略的技术基础，“这样公众就可以看到这些优先考虑的技术领域。”她说，工业界也可以看到一个机密版本，“让你更多地了解为什么”某些技术是优先考虑的，而其他技术不是优先考虑的“。它将包含“一个你不会在非机密版本中看到的理由”版本。Shyu说，她急于将新技术“转移”到运营商手中。但是“每个人对‘过渡’都有不同的定义，”她说。显而易见的是，当一个“先进的原型”变成一个记录程序时，但“它可能是一个落入战斗机手中的软件……它可能是两用的东西，我们决定商业化。这是一个成功的过渡：我们资助了它；它变成了商业；我们从架子上买。“Shyu还说，她正在更有效地利用技术资金。新的数据系统让她以以前没有的细节水平洞察了五角大楼科技和研发企业的技术项目，“我们正在与工业界分享这一点。”她说，她每月与大小公司举行会议，寻求对五角大楼科技企业工作“痛点”的反馈。她的商店还专注于国际合作，分享有助于避免重复工作和产生双方都可以使用的结果的信息。作为一个例子，她引用了与澳大利亚的SCIFIRE吸气高超音速倡议，她说该倡议帮助空军为高超音速攻击巡航导弹做出了下选择。“每一个新的想法都不是在这里发明的，对吗？”Shyu说，并补充说，她希望在“integr”的应用程序中“广泛观察”合作伙伴和盟友的技术", "中文源标题": "Shyu说战争游戏定义了研发投资；新的NDS技术文档即将发布", "英文整编": "On November 3rd, Xu Ruobing, Deputy Secretary of Research and Engineering of the US Department of Defense, said at the acquisition meeting that the results of war chess deduction and asymmetric advantages are promoting the investment choice of the Ministry of Defense in new technologies.

Jim Dickinson.\n“Those are things that we’re looking at right now,” he told the Mitchell Institute in an online talk today.\nSPACECOM on Nov. 15 announced it had created a new headquarters structure, called theCombined Joint Task Force-Space Operations (CJTF-SO), to oversee those two commands responsible for day-to-day operations: theJoint Task Force-Space Defense(JTF-SD) and theCombined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC).\nThe JTF-SD, headquartered at Schriever SFB, Colo., is responsible for protecting and defending US space assets, including those belonging to the Intelligence Community via the bilateralNational Space Defense Center. The CFSCC, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Ca., takes care of space support functions for military operators, such as managing access to communications satellites and operating the GPS constellation. It is called a “combined force” command because it includes allied representatives.\nThe establishment of the CJTF-SO headquarters structure, Dickinson explained, was aimed at providing more “agility” and “flexibility” in decision-making than the old structure, which saw the leaders of both sub-commands reporting directly to him and SPACECOM headquarters staff.\nThe reorganization also means SPACECOM “will be able to synchronize both what we do from a space-enabling perspective as well as what we do for protect and defend on orbit,” and to avoid potential overlaps between those two inter-related missions, he said.\n“And so the purpose of CJTF-SO, as most higher headquarters, will be the synchronization of those missions and synchronization of those resources,” Dickinson said.\nAs a first step, he said, the new CJTF-SO headquarters staff is working now to establish “its functions and roles and missions,” leading up to a SPACECOM declaration of initial operational capability (IOC).\nBut Dickinson suggested SPACECOM wanted to see if it could go further to streamline that decision-making structure, by looking at “whether or not we need two command centers, whether they could be one — I mean, those are all options that we’re looking at right now,” he added.\nA SPACECOM spokesperson later in the day clarified that Dickinson was talking about two of the handful of operations centers that ultimately report up to him, rather than to overarching subordinate commands.\n“Gen. Dickinson was referencing a number of options the command is considering to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. When asked directly about any potential further consolidation, his response was referring to two of the operational centers within the command, not the operational commands themselves, as one of many options,” the spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense.\nDickinson also praised the Space Force’sNov. 23 standupof a new service component command at US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.\n“I believe that’s the right place at the right time for that element to stand up,” he said.\nIn response to questions about how the INDOPACOM Space Force component — and by implication future planned service components at other combatant commands — will work with SPACECOM’s own regionally embeddedJoint Integrated Space Teams, Dickinson expressed no concerns about possible crossed wires.\nThe Space Force is a military service with the mission to organize, train and equip forces for operational combatant commands, of which SPACECOM is one. SPACECOM, which is both a geographical and a functional command, is responsible for ensuring other combatant commands are being provided necessary space capabilities to do their warfighting jobs, and that SPACECOM operators are responding to theater needs.\nFor example, Dickinson waived away the specter that the Space Force component might inject an additional layer of decision-making bureaucracy into the process for providing space capabilities to warfighters in the field.\n“There won’t be an additional layer,” he said. The Space Force component’s creation “is actually enhancing the relationship, if you will, between INDOPACOM and US Space Command,” he said.\nDickinson explained that all the other services have component commands at INDOPACOM — just as they do at all six other geographic combatant commands — and that the Space Force’s component will work in the same traditional way.\n“So, the INDOPACOM commander will look to that … space service component for all things space, if you will, in terms of support of his operations in his respective AOR [area of operations],” he said. “What will happen at that point will be the normal integration and coordination that would happen — that has happened [and] is happening right now — between that component and US Space Command in terms of making sure that we provide the space enabling capabilities that the INDOPACOM commander needs in support of his operations.”\nThe Guardians making up the service component command “work directly for the INDOPACOM commander, but there is a coordination relationship that already exists” with SPACECOM via the CFSCC, Dickinson added.\nThe CFSCC “executes tactical control over globally dispersed Air Force, Army, and Navy space [and now Space Force] units that command ground-based space capabilities and satellites in every orbital regime,” SPACECOM’swebsiteexplains.\nIn fact, Dickinson elaborated, Space Force created the new component by assigning to it Guardians already at INDOPACOM and familiar with the coordination process.\n“So, that relationship already exists and will continue to exist,” he said, and “will mature.”\n", "中文原文": "特里萨·希钦森2022年11月29日下午2:28华盛顿--据太空司令部司令吉姆·迪金森将军称，一旦刚刚宣布的重组到位，美国太空司令部已经在考虑进一步精简，包括合并其两个作战中心。“这些都是我们现在正在关注的事情，”他在今天的一次在线演讲中告诉米切尔研究所。11月15日，太空司令部宣布建立了一个新的总部结构，称为联合特遣部队-太空作战(CJTF-SO)，以监督负责日常行动的两个司令部：联合特遣部队-太空防御（JTF-SD）和联合部队太空组成司令部(CFSCC)。总部设在科罗拉多州施里弗SFB的JTF-SD负责保护和保卫美国太空资产，包括通过双边国家太空防御中心属于情报界的资产。总部设在加利福尼亚州范登堡SFB的CFSCC负责军事运营商的空间支持功能，如管理通信卫星的访问和操作GPS星座。它被称为“联合部队”司令部，因为它包括盟军代表。迪金森解释说，CJTF-SO总部结构的建立旨在提供比旧结构更多的决策“敏捷性”和“灵活性”，旧结构中两个子指挥部的领导人直接向他和太空司令部的工作人员报告。他说，重组还意味着SPACECOM“将能够从空间赋能的角度同步我们的工作，以及我们在轨道上保护和防御的工作”，并避免这两个相互关联的任务之间的潜在重叠。迪金森说：“因此，CJTF的目的--作为最高级的总部，将是这些任务和资源的同步。”他说，作为第一步，新的CJTF-SO总部工作人员现在正在努力建立“它的职能、作用和任务”，最终宣布初始操作能力(IOC)。但迪金森建议SPACECOM希望看看是否可以进一步简化决策结构，看看“我们是否需要两个指挥中心，它们是否可以是一个--我的意思是，这些都是我们现在正在考虑的选择，”他补充说。SPACECOM的一名发言人当天晚些时候澄清说，迪金森谈论的是最终向他报告的少数几个作战中心中的两个，而不是向最高的下级司令部报告。“将军。迪金森提到了司令部正在考虑的一些选项，以确保效率和效力。当被直接问及任何潜在的进一步整合时，他的回应是指司令部内的两个作战中心，而不是作战司令部本身，作为许多选择之一，“这位发言人在给打破防御的电子邮件中说。迪金森还赞扬了太空部队的11月23站在夏威夷美国印度-太平洋司令部总部的一个新的服务组成司令部。“我相信这是在正确的时间、正确的地点，让这种元素站起来，”他说。在回答关于INDOPACOM太空部队部分--以及暗示其他作战司令部未来计划的服务部分--将如何与SPACECOM自己的区域嵌入联合综合太空小组合作的问题时，迪金森对可能的交叉电线表示不担心。太空部队是一个兵种，其任务是为作战指挥组织、训练和装备部队，太空司令部就是其中之一。太空司令部既是地理司令部，也是职能司令部，它负责确保其他作战司令部获得必要的太空能力来完成作战任务，并确保太空司令部操作员对战区需求做出反应。例如，迪金森放弃了太空部队部门可能会在向战场上的战斗人员提供太空能力的过程中注入额外的决策层官僚机构的恐惧。“不会有额外的一层，”他说。他说，太空部队组成部分的创建“实际上是在加强INDOPACOM和美国太空司令部之间的关系，如果你愿意的话”。迪金森解释说，所有其他军种在INDOPACOM都有组成司令部--就像他们在所有其他六个地理作战司令部一样--太空部队的组成司令部将以同样的传统方式工作。他说：“因此，INDOPACOM指挥官将在支持他在各自的AOR（行动区）的行动方面，为太空的所有事情寻求……太空服务部门。”“届时将会发生的是该组成部分和美国太空司令部之间将会发生的正常整合和协调--已经发生和正在发生--以确保我们提供太空支持", "中文源标题": "太空探索进一步完善指挥链", "英文整编": "Jim Dickinson, commander of the US Space Command, said that the Space Command will continue to integrate, streamline and optimize the space command chain.

As the geographical and functional command, the Indo-Pacific Regional Space Command will ensure that other departments obtain the space combat capability needed to complete combat missions."}, {"中文标题": "朝鲜或在2023年进行核试验", "情报来源": "俄罗斯塔斯社网站", "时间": "2023年1月30日", "整编内容": "俄罗斯国际事务委员会总干事科尔图诺夫2023年1月30日表示，朝鲜可能在2023年进行核试验，美国或韩国更严厉的言辞不会阻止朝鲜领导人的决定。在分析当前朝鲜半岛的紧张局势时，这位专家提醒人们注意韩国总统尹锡悦2023年1月初发表的声明。该声明称，如果朝鲜核计划导致朝鲜半岛局势恶化，韩国可能会从另一个国家获得核武器，或者制造自己的核武器。该声明是在北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格访问韩国和日本前夕发表的。朝鲜国际政策科学学会的一名工作人员称，这是亚太地区“对抗和战争的前奏”。科尔图诺夫认为，在这种背景下，不排除为了报复，朝鲜在2023年进行核试验。朝鲜宪法对核武器的地位有明确规定。无论如何，朝鲜都不会放弃核武器。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中核战略规划研究总院", "源网址": "https://tass.com/defense/1569053", "源标题": "Pyongyang may stage nuclear test in 2023 — Russian expert", "原文": "30 JAN, 23:33\nAndrey Kortunov noted that South Korea and the United States’ harsher rhetoric will not work as a deterrent, while China does enjoy certain political influence on Pyongyang\nPyongyang\n? Alexandr Demyanchuk/TASS\nMOSCOW, January 30. /TASS/. Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test in 2023, thus such a development should not be ruled out, the general director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov, told TASS on Monday.\nHe is certain that harsher rhetoric by the United States or South Korea will do nothing to deter the DPRK’s leadership.\nWhile analyzing the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the expert drew attention to South Korean President Yoon Sok-yeol’s statement in early January that South Korea might host nuclear weapons of another state or create its own, should the situation on the peninsula get worse due to North Korea’s nuclear program. Yoon’s statement came on the eve of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s visits to Seoul and Tokyo, which a staffer of the DPRK’s International Policy Science Society, Kim Dong Myung, has already dubbed \"a prelude to confrontation and war\" in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR). Kortunov believes that against this background, it should not be ruled out that in its attempts to retaliate, Pyongyang may go as far as staging a nuclear test in 2023.\n\"We cannot write off this possibility,\" he stressed. \"Ballistic missile tests are already underway. Some very belligerent statements are being made by the North Korean leadership. Nuclear tests cannot be excluded. In any case, the DPRK, of course, will not give up nuclear weapons. This status is spelled out in the country’s Constitution.\"\nAt the same time, Kortunov noted that South Korea and the United States’ harsher rhetoric will not work as a deterrent, while China does enjoy certain political influence on Pyongyang. \"If Pyongyang shows restraint, it will do so not because of some statements by South Korea or the United States, or Japan. It may turn an attentive ear to China, since North Korean tests, to be carried out in the north, not far from the Chinese border, naturally, cause concern not only in the capitals of the DPRK’s geopolitical opponents, but also in Beijing and in Moscow,\" he continued.\nThe expert pointed out that amid mutual distrust in the region one should expect wider bilateral cooperation between South Korea and the United States and between South Korea and Japan. Overall tensions in the Asia-Pacific Region may soar. \"A variety of scenarios is possible,\" Kortunov noted. \"For one, the situation may aggravate along the demarcation line between North Korea and South Korea.

SITUATION. I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] secured his third term and set his war council in October 2022. Taiwan’s presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a reason. United States’ presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a distracted America. Xi’s team, reason, and opportunity are all aligned for 2025. We spent 2022 setting the foundation for victory. We will spend 2023 in crisp operational motion building on that foundation. If you want to know what the operational motion I demand looks like, look at what Total Force Team Charleston did in January.\n2. COMMANDER’S INTENT. Go faster. Drive readiness, integration, and agility for ourselves and the Joint Force to deter, and if required, defeat China. This is the first of 8 monthly directives from me. You need to know I alone own the pen on these orders. My expectations are high, and these orders are not up for negotiation. Follow them. I will be tough, fair, and loving in my approach to secure victory.\n3. END STATE. A fortified, ready, integrated, and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain. Maximize the use of the force and the tools we currently have and extract full value from things that currently exist. Close the gaps: C2, navigation, maneuver under attack, and tempo.\n4. RISK. Run deliberately, not recklessly. You will be governed by the principle of calculated training risk, which you shall interpret to mean the avoidance of death, serious injury, and Class A damage to attain higher readiness, integration, and agility. If the Tactic, Technique, and Procedure you are developing increases AMC’s ability to fight and win inside the first island chain… move out. If you are comfortable in your approach to training, then you are not taking enough risk.\n5. OT&E. Attached are our OT&E efforts from 2022 Fall PHOENIX Rally, which will guide our preparation but are not intended to limit creativity of approach. This is not an all-encompassing list. I expect you to move out briskly on the monthly tasks, anticipate the projected tasks and weave them eloquently into your units’ training and operational battle rhythms.\n6. FEBRUARY. (a) All AMC aligned personnel with weapons qualifications will fire a clip into a 7-meter target with the full understanding that unrepentant lethality matters most. Aim for the head. (b) All AMC personnel will update vRED [virtual Record of Emergency Data]. (c) All commanders will acknowledge this order directly to me immediately. Then, report all 2022 accomplishments preparing for the China fight, and forecast major efforts in 2023 through command chains by COB 28 February 2023.\n7. MARCH (Projected). (a) All units will report progress toward established OT&E requirements for INDOPACOM Operations discussed and reviewed at Fall PHOENIX Rally. (b) All AMC personnel will consider their personal affairs and whether a visit should be scheduled with their servicing base legal office to ensure they are legally ready and prepared. (c) KC-135 units will coordinate to provide a conceptual means of air delivering 100 off-the-shelf size and type UAVs from a single aircraft.\n8. APRIL (Projected).

The Russian Kornet anti-tank missile system is capable of piercing any smart active protection system of armor with a paired launch of missiles, Editor-in-Chief of Independent Military Review Dmitry Litovkin told TASS on Wednesday.\n\"It was pointed out that the Kornet self-propelled anti-tank missile systems can fire in tandem mode, specifically, two missiles can be launched at a time within a single command and control field to pierce the enemy armor’s active protection system.

This research area, known as integrated photonics, is fast evolving and investigators are now exploring the shorter—visible—wavelength range to develop a broad variety of emerging applications. These include chip-scale LIDAR (light detection and ranging), AR/VR/MR (augmented/virtual/mixed reality) goggles, holographic displays, quantum information processing chips, and implantable optogenetic probes in the brain.\nThe one device critical to all these applications in the visible range is an optical phase modulator, which controls the phase of a light wave, similar to how the phase of radio waves is modulated in wireless computer networks. With a phase modulator, researchers can build an on-chip optical switch that channels light into different waveguide ports. With a large network of these optical switches, researchers could create sophisticated integrated optical systems that could control light propagating on a tiny chip or light emission from the chip.\nBut phase modulators in the visible range are very hard to make: there are no materials that are transparent enough in the visible spectrum while also providing large tunability, either through thermo-optical or electro-optical effects. Currently, the two most suitable materials are silicon nitride and lithium niobate. While both are highly transparent in the visible range, neither one provides very much tunability. Visible-spectrum phase modulators based on these materials are thus not only large but also power-hungry: the length of individual waveguide-based modulators ranges from hundreds of microns to several mm and a single modulator consumes tens of mW for phase tuning. Researchers trying to achieve large-scale integration—embedding thousands of devices on a single microchip—have, up to now, been stymied by these bulky, energy-consuming devices.\nToday, Columbia Engineering researchers announced that they have found a solution to this problem—they've developed a way based on micro-ring resonators to dramatically reduce both the size and the power consumption of a visible-spectrum phase modulator, from 1 mm to 10 microns and from tens of mW for π phase tuning to below 1 mW. The study was published today by Nature Photonics.\n\"Usually the bigger something is, the better. But integrated devices are a notable exception,\" said Nanfang Yu, associate professor of applied physics, co-principal investigator (PI) on the team, and an expert in nanophotonics. \"It's really hard to confine light to a spot and manipulate it without losing much of its power. We are excited that in this work we've made a breakthrough that will greatly expand the horizon of large-scale visible-spectrum integrated photonics.\"\nConventional optical phase modulators operating at visible wavelengths are based on light propagation in waveguides. Yu worked with his colleague Michal Lipson, who is the leading expert on integrated photonics based on silicon nitride, to develop a very different approach.\n\"The key to our solution was to use an optical resonator and to operate it in the so-called strongly over-coupled regime,\" said Lipson, co-PI on the team and Eugene Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of applied physics.\nOptical resonators are structures with a high degree of symmetry, such as rings that can cycle a beam of light many times and translate tiny refractive index changes to a large phase modulation. Resonators can operate under several different conditions and so need to be used carefully. For example, if operating in the \"under coupled\" or \"critical coupled\" regimes, a resonator will only provide a limited phase modulation and, more problematically, introduce a large amplitude variation to the optical signal. The latter is a highly undesirable optical loss because accumulation of even moderate losses from individual phase modulators will prevent cascading them to form a circuit that has a sufficiently large output signal.\nTo achieve a complete 2π phase tuning and minimal amplitude variation, the Yu-Lipson team chose to operate a micro-ring in the \"strongly over-coupled\" regime, a condition where the coupling strength between the micro-ring and the \"bus\" waveguide that feeds light into the ring is at least 10 times stronger than the loss of the micro-ring. \"The latter is primarily due to optical scattering at the nanoscale roughness on the device sidewalls,\" Lipson explained. \"You can never fabricate photonic devices with perfectly smooth surfaces.\"\nThe team developed several strategies to push the devices into the strongly over-coupled regime. The most crucial one was their invention of an adiabatic micro-ring geometry, where the ring smoothly transitions between a narrow neck and a wide belly, which are at the opposite edges of the ring. The narrow neck of the ring facilitates the exchange of light between the bus waveguide and the micro-ring, thus enhancing the coupling strength. The ring's wide belly reduces optical loss because the guided light interacts only with the outer sidewall, not the inner sidewall, of the widened portion of the adiabatic micro-ring, substantially reducing optical scattering at the sidewall roughness.\nIn a comparative study of adiabatic micro-rings and conventional micro-rings with uniform width fabricated side by side on the same chip, the team found that none of the conventional micro-rings satisfied the strong over-coupling condition—in fact, they suffered very bad optical losses—while 63% of the adiabatic micro-rings kept operating in the strongly over-coupled regime.\n\"Our best phase modulators operating at the blue and green colors, which are the most difficult portion of the visible spectrum, have a radius of only 5 microns, consume power of 0.8 mW for π phase tuning, and introduce an amplitude variation of less than 10%,\" said Heqing Huang, a graduate student in Yu's lab and first author of the paper. \"No prior work has demonstrated such compact, power-efficient, and low-loss phase modulators at visible wavelengths.\"\nThe devices were designed in Yu's lab and fabricated in the Columbia Nano Initiative cleanroom, at the Advanced Science Research Center NanoFabrication Facility at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. Device characterization was conducted in Lipson's and Yu's labs.\nThe researchers note that while they are nowhere near the degree of integration of electronics, their work shrinks the gap between photonic and electronic switches substantially. \"If previous modulator technologies only allow for integration of 100 waveguide phase modulators given a certain chip footprint and power budget, now we can do that 100 times better and integrate 10,000 phase shifters on chip to realize much more sophisticated functions,\" said Yu.\nThe Lipson and Yu labs are now collaborating to demonstrate visible-spectrum LIDAR consisting of large 2D arrays of phase shifters based on adiabatic micro-rings. The design strategies employed for their visible-spectrum thermo-optical devices can be applied to electro-optical modulators to reduce their footprints and drive voltages, and can be adapted in other spectral ranges (e.g., ultraviolet, telecom, mid-infrared, and THz) and in other resonator designs beyond micro-rings.\n\"Thus, our work can inspire future effort where people can implement strong over-coupling in a wide range of resonator-based devices to enhance light-matter interactions, for example, for enhancing optical nonlinearity, for making novel lasers, for observing novel quantum optical effects, while suppressing optical losses at the same time,\" Lipson said.\n", "中文原文": "在过去的几十年里，研究人员已经从使用电流转向在近红外范围内操纵光波，用于电信应用，如高速5G网络、芯片上的生物传感器和无人驾驶汽车。这个被称为集成光子学的研究领域正在迅速发展，研究人员正在探索更短的可见波长范围，以开发各种各样的新兴应用。其中包括芯片级激光雷达（光探测和测距）、AR/VR/MR（增强/虚拟/混合现实）护目镜、全息显示器、量子信息处理芯片，以及大脑中可植入的光基因探针。在可见光范围内，对所有这些应用至关重要的一个设备是光学相位调制器，它控制光波的相位，类似于无线计算机网络中无线电波的相位调制。利用相位调制器，研究人员可以构建一个片上光开关，将光引导到不同的波导端口。有了这些光开关的大型网络，研究人员可以创建复杂的集成光学系统，可以控制光在微小芯片上传播或芯片上的光发射。但是在可见光范围内的相位调制器很难制作：没有一种材料可以通过热光或电光效应在可见光光谱中足够透明，同时提供大的可调谐性。目前最合适的两种材料是氮化硅和铌酸锂。虽然两者在可见范围内都是高度透明的，但都没有提供太多的可调性。因此，基于这些材料的可见光谱相位调制器不仅体积大，而且耗电巨大：单个波导调制器的长度从数百微米到几毫米不等，单个调制器用于相位调谐需要几十毫瓦。研究人员试图实现大规模集成--在单个微芯片上嵌入数千个设备--迄今为止，一直被这些笨重、耗能的设备所阻碍。今天，哥伦比亚大学工程研究人员宣布，他们已经找到了解决这个问题的方法--他们开发了一种基于微环谐振器的方法，可以大幅降低可见光谱相位调制器的尺寸和功耗，从1毫米降低到10微米，从π相位调谐的几十毫瓦降低到1毫瓦以下。这项研究发表在今天的《自然·光子学》杂志上。“通常东西越大越好。但集成器件是一个明显的例外，”应用物理学副教授、该团队的联合首席研究员(PI)和纳米光子学专家南方·余说。“将光限制在一个点上并在不损失大部分功率的情况下操纵它真的很难。我们感到兴奋的是，在这项工作中，我们取得了突破，将大大拓展大规模可见光谱集成光子学的视野。”在可见光波段工作的传统光学相位调制器是基于光在波导中的传播。Yu与他的同事Michal Lipson合作，开发了一种非常不同的方法。Michal Lipson是基于氮化硅的集成光子学方面的领先专家。“我们解决方案的关键是使用光学谐振器，并在所谓的强过耦合状态下操作它，”该团队的合作伙伴、尤金·希金斯电气工程教授和应用物理学教授利普森说。光学谐振腔是一种具有高度对称性的结构，例如可以将一束光循环多次并将微小的折射率变化转化为大的相位调制的环。谐振器可以在几种不同的条件下工作，因此需要小心使用。例如，如果在“欠耦合”或“临界耦合”状态下工作，谐振器将只提供有限的相位调制，并且更有问题的是，将较大的振幅变化引入光信号。后者是非常不希望的光损耗，因为来自单个相位调制器的即使中等损耗的积累也将阻止它们级联以形成具有足够大输出信号的电路。为了实现完整的2π相位调谐和最小的振幅变化，Yu-Lipson团队选择在“强过耦合”状态下操作微环，在这种状态下，微环与向环中输入光的“总线”波导之间的耦合强度至少比微环的损耗强10倍。“后者主要是由于器件侧壁上纳米级粗糙度的光学散射，”Lipson解释说。“你永远无法制造出表面完美光滑的光子器件。”该团队开发了几种策略来推动设备进入强烈的过度耦合状态。最关键的一个是他们发明了绝热微环几何结构，环在窄脖子和宽肚子之间平稳地过渡，这两者是对立的", "中文源标题": "一种新的器件可以以最小的占地面积和最低的功耗调制可见光而不使其变暗", "英文整编": "Recently, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of Columbia University has developed a new method based on micro-ring resonator, which is expected to greatly reduce the size and power consumption of visible spectrum phase modulator from 1 mm to 10 microns, and the power consumption of π phase tuning from tens of milliwatts to below 1 milliwatt, providing a new technical scheme for the research and development of phase modulator.

In order to better make the equipment enter a strong over-coupling state, researchers invented an adiabatic micro-ring geometry to enhance the coupling strength and reduce the optical scattering at the roughness of the sidewall. This research provides a new technical support for the research and development of new phase modulators."}, {"中文标题": "美国测试最新升级的“爱国者”防空导弹系统", "情报来源": "军事透露网", "时间": "2022年8月25日", "整编内容": "美国已开始对“爱国者”防空导弹系统最新升级型进行为期一年的测试。此次升级是2018年以来的最新的一次升级。从2022年6月初开始，美国陆军作战试验司令部防空反导试验局与第30防空炮兵旅第6防空炮兵测试分队第3营和多个政府机构一起测试升级后的系统。除了软件和硬件升级外，系统的用户界面也更为友好，可提高士兵的训练效率。升级后的“爱国者”防空导弹系统将至少服役到2040年。美国陆军作战试验司令部位于德克萨斯州胡德堡，是美国陆军唯一的独立作战试验机构，其防空反导试验局负责规划和执行防空反导相关项目的独立作战试验。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "北方科技信息研究所", "源网址": "https://militaryleak.com/2022/08/25/us-army-air-defenders-test-newest-patriot-missile-system-upgrades/", "源标题": "MilitaryLeak", "原文": "Breaking Military News And Defense Technology.\nSearch for:\nclose\nUS Army Air Defenders Test Newest Patriot Missile System Upgrades\nUS Army Air Defenders Test Newest Patriot Missile System Upgrades\nAugust 25, 2022byAdmin\nSixty-five Soldiers and 135 Government Civilians started a yearlong test on the latest Patriot Missile System upgrade.

Future increments of PrSM, the upcoming replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System, are expected to feature an anti-ship seeker, increased lethality and extended range. But the Army has not previously said that the extra range would come from a ramjet. Senior Army acquisition and modernization officials disclosed the ramjet plans and previous testing in testimony submitted for a Senate Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee hearing today. “We successfully tested the Land Based Anti-Ship Missile seeker and Extended Range Propulsion ramjet, setting conditions for subsequent increments of the PrSM program,” the written testimony states. A ramjet is a form of air-breathing engine that relies upon high-velocity forward motion to compress air. Unlike a traditional jet engine, a ramjet doesn't require a fan to compress air. Compared to more traditional missiles, which carry oxidizers with their fuel, ramjets would provide greater range at less weight, Al Shoffner, a retired Army two-star general and a former director of the Fires Center of Excellence, told Inside Defense. “The advantage it has over a conventional rocket or missile is that it doesn’t have to carry as much fuel because it’s mixed with oxygen as it travels,” Shoffner said. “That allows a few things: One, reduction in weight, which is really critical, and then more room for other things that you would require payload for, such as a guidance system and the warhead.” The Army has not fielded a system with a ramjet before, he said. They have been a topic of study “for a long time,” and the technology has improved in recent years. “I think we’re to the point where we’re more confident that this will actually work, and that it can be demonstrated,” Shoffner said. Army applied research budget documents detail plans to develop an “air-breathing propulsion subsystem,” which is likely the ramjet program, for a future PrSM variant. The Army “will complete flight weight combined cycle air-breathing propulsion subsystem design and begin fabrication and integration for follow-on experiments and assessments” in fiscal year 2023, according to the budget documents. The budget request includes $8.8 million for that line of effort. Experiments in FY-22 will explore the ability of the same “air-breathing propulsion subsystem” to increase missile range “in the same form factor as traditional solid propellant rocket motor subsystems,” according to the budget documents. These science and technology developments will inform the range requirements for the future extended-range PrSM increment, the director of the Army’s Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team told Inside Defense in October. PrSM has become one of the lead programs in the Army’s long-range fires modernization priority, which it expects will be necessary for future large-scale combat. The missile is compatible with existing rocket launchers, and two PrSMs can fit in the same rocket pod that holds a single ATACMS. An initial increment of PrSM is on schedule to be fielded at the end of FY-23 under an urgent materiel release, according to Army budget documents. That base missile will have a range of at least 500 kilometers, although the exact capability is currently unknown. Telemetry data stopped at 499 km in an October maximum-distance test, but the missile flew farther, according to the former chief of Army Futures Command. Initial operational testing on the base PrSM is planned for the first quarter of FY-25, and the missile could reach initial operational capability by the fourth quarter of that year. A demonstration of PrSM Increment 2, with the ship-hunting seeker, could take place at the beginning of FY-27, and that variant of the missile could be fielded by the end of FY-27. Increments 3 and 4, with increased lethality and extended range, would follow. The Army has funded research into ramjets that could extend the range of cannon artillery. A round would be shot out of a cannon using traditional artillery propellants, and the ramjet could turn on once the round reaches high enough speeds. A ramjet-powered missile would still require traditional missile propulsion, so that it can reach the speeds necessary for the ramjet to work, Shoffner said. A ramjet is typically most efficient at two or three times the speed of sound.\n", "中文原文": "5月10日军方高级官员称，军方已经测试了一种冲压发动机，该发动机可以为未来的增程型精确打击导弹提供动力。PrSM的未来增量，即将取代陆军战术导弹系统，预计将具有反舰导引头，增加杀伤力和扩大射程。但军方此前没有表示额外的射程将来自冲压发动机。陆军高级采购和现代化官员在今天提交给参议院武装部队战术空军和陆军小组委员会听证会的证词中披露了冲压发动机计划和以前的测试。书面证词称：“我们成功测试了陆基反舰导弹导引头和增程推进冲压发动机，为PrSM计划的后续增量创造了条件。”冲压发动机是一种依靠高速前进运动来压缩空气的吸气发动机。与传统的喷气发动机不同，冲压发动机不需要风扇来压缩空气。退役陆军二星上将、消防卓越中心前主任阿尔·肖夫纳（Al Shoffner）告诉《国防内幕》(Inside Defens)，与燃料中携带氧化剂的更传统的导弹相比，冲压发动机将以更轻的重量提供更大的射程。“它比传统火箭或导弹的优势是，它不必携带那么多燃料，因为它在旅行时与氧气混合，”肖夫纳说。“这允许一些事情：第一，减轻重量，这非常关键，然后为其他需要有效载荷的东西提供更多空间，如制导系统和弹头。”他说，陆军以前没有用冲压发动机部署过系统。它们一直是研究的主题“很长一段时间”，技术近年来有所改进。肖夫纳说：“我认为我们已经到了这样一个地步，即我们更有信心这确实会奏效，而且可以证明这一点。”陆军应用研究预算文件详细计划为未来的PrSM变体开发“吸气推进子系统”，这可能是冲压发动机计划。根据预算文件，陆军“将在2023财年完成飞行重量联合循环吸气推进子系统的设计，并开始制造和集成，以进行后续实验和评估”。预算要求包括用于这一工作的880万美元。根据预算文件，FY-22的实验将探索相同的“吸气推进子系统”以“与传统固体推进剂火箭发动机子系统相同的形状因子”增加导弹射程的能力。这些科学和技术的发展将为未来增程PrSM增量的射程要求提供信息，陆军远程精确火力跨职能小组主任在10月份告诉《国防内幕》。PrSM已经成为陆军远程火力现代化优先考虑的主要项目之一，它预计这将是未来大规模作战所必需的。该导弹与现有的火箭发射器兼容，两个PRSM可以安装在同一个装有单个ATACMS的火箭吊舱中。根据陆军预算文件，根据紧急物资释放，初步增加的PrSM将在FY-23年底部署。该基地导弹将有至少500公里的射程，尽管确切的能力目前尚不清楚。根据前陆军未来司令部司令的说法，在10月份的最大距离测试中，遥测数据停止在499公里，但导弹飞得更远。基地PrSM的初始作战测试计划在FY-25的第一季度进行，该导弹可能在当年第四季度达到初始作战能力。PrSM增量2与猎舰导引头的演示可以在FY-27开始时进行，该导弹的变体可以在FY-27结束时部署。随后将增加3和4，增加杀伤力和扩大射程。陆军已经资助了冲压发动机的研究，这种发动机可以扩大加农炮的射程。一发子弹将使用传统的火炮推进剂从大炮中发射出来，一旦子弹达到足够高的速度，冲压发动机就可以打开。肖夫纳说，冲压发动机动力导弹仍然需要传统的导弹推进，以便能够达到冲压发动机工作所需的速度。冲压发动机的效率通常是声速的两到三倍。", "中文源标题": "陆军测试了未来PrSM变体的冲压发动机", "英文整编": "In his testimony to the Armed Forces Committee of the Senate on May 10, the senior officials of the US Army revealed that the shore-based anti-ship missile seeker and the \"Extended Range Propulsion\" (ERP) ramjet test have been successfully completed, and both of them are expected to be equipped with \"Precision Strike Missile\" (PrSM) in the future."}, {"中文标题": "吉尔吉斯斯坦采购土耳其“矛隼”和“突袭者”无人机", "情报来源": "土耳其defensehere网站", "时间": "2022年11月26日", "整编内容": "吉尔吉斯斯坦国家安全委员会主席披露，吉尔吉斯斯坦已经采购了土耳其的“突袭者”（AKINCI）和“矛隼”（AKSUNGUR）无人机，并成为土耳其“矛隼”无人机的第一个外国客户。吉尔吉斯斯坦预计将使用“突袭者”以及TB2无人机沿着塔吉克斯坦边境执行侦察和监视任务，也有可能使用“矛隼”无人机执行作战任务。\n土耳其海军、空军和特种部队正在积极使用“矛隼”无人机。“矛隼”无人机是土耳其航空工业公司研制的中空长航时无人机，是“安卡”无人机的一种更大的先进型号，能够昼夜执行情报、监视、侦察和攻击任务，还可用于电子和信号情报行动。该无人机长11.6米，翼展24米；最大升限12192米，作战半径250千米，最大载荷750千克，最大起飞重量3300千克；由两台TEI PD-170涡轮增压发动机提供动力，最高速度180千米/小时；在一次攻击/海军巡逻任务中，能以750千克外部载荷飞行12小时，在一次信号情报任务中，能以150千克有效载荷飞行24小时；配有6个挂点，其中每个机翼三个挂点，从内到外额定重量分别为500千克、300千克和150千克；可搭载多种武器系统，包括MAM-L激光制导炸弹、 MAM-C微型空地导弹、Cirit激光制导火箭弹、L-UMTAS反坦克导弹、TEBER-81激光制导炸弹、 TEBER-82激光制导炸弹、KGK-82制导炸弹、HGK-3制导炸弹和微型炸弹。\n2020年8月，“矛隼”无人机搭载12枚MAM-L激光制导炸弹进行了飞行试验。此外，土耳其还利用“矛隼”无人机测试了洛克桑公司为Mk-82通用炸弹开发的TEBER-82制导套件和土耳其联合科学技术研发委员会与土耳其国防工业研究发展学会开发的KGK-S?HA-82制导套件。\n“突袭者”无人机是土耳其拜卡尔公司最新推出的产品，长12.5米，翼展20米，高4.1米；最大起飞重量5500千克，续航时间25小时，最大速度361千米/小时；具有8个挂点，可搭载多种武器系统。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "北方科技信息研究所", "源网址": "https://www.overtdefense.com/2022/11/08/kyrgyzstan-to-purchase-aksungur-uavs-from-turkey-after-acquiring-bayraktar-tb2-and-bayraktar-akinci-drones/", "源标题": "Kyrgyzstan To Purchase Aksungur UAVs From Turkey After Acquiring Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Ak?nc?

With this, it was made apparent that Kyrgyzstan is AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer.\nThe Kyrgyzstan National Security State Committee’s press center and TAI have not made an official statement about how many AKSUNGUR drones Kyrgyzstan will purchase, what configurations these UAVs will be in, or the cost of the deal. Kyrgyzstan, which had previously purchased Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Ak?nc? drones from Turkey, also did not share the specifics of those agreements. Kyrgyzstan is expected to use these vehicles, along with Bayraktar TB2 and Ak?nc? drones, primarily in reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the Tajikistan border. Kyrgyzstan, which has frequent border disputes with Tajikistan, is also likely to employ Aksungur’s combat capabilities.\nFollowing its first export success with Kyrgyzstan, Aksungur’s next customer appears to be Indonesia. TAI General Manager Temel Kotil told SavunmaSanayiST at the Indo Defense Expo & Forum 2022 Fair held in Jakarta from November 2-5 that Indonesia needs ANKA and AKSUNGUR unmanned aerial vehicles. “We don’t discuss ventures that haven’t signed a contract,” Kotil continued in his statement, “but we will continue to discuss all of these products with the authorities here, and I’m hoping for good news from Indonesia.” Furthermore, TAI UAV Systems Deputy General Manager Dr. ?mer Y?ld?z told Anadolu Agency in September that two of three African countries are interested in purchasing Aksungur drones, with one interested in Anka UAVs. Furthermore, the Algerian-based MENADefense website reported last month that Algeria had ordered six TAI AKSUNGUR UAVs. According to the reports, Algeria was AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer with this deal. TAI, however, later denied this information.\nThe Turkish Navy, Air Force, and Special Missions (MT) are currently actively using the Aksungur, an advanced and larger version of the ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle. According to TAI, the Aksungur’s developer, the drone is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) class capable of performing Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and offensive operations day and night with EO/IR, SAR, and SIGINT payloads. In addition to its many other uses, Aksungur can be used for electronic and signal intelligence operations.\nAksungur has a length of 11.6 meters, a wingspan of 24 meters, a maximum take-off weight of 3300 kilograms, and a cargo capacity of 750 kilograms. Due to two TEI PD-170 turbo diesel engines with three-bladed propellers, the drone has 340 horsepower and a top speed of 100 knots (180 km/h) at sea level. The drone can fly for 12 hours with 750 kg of external payload during an Assault/Naval Patrol Mission, and 24 hours with 150 kg of payload during a Signal Intelligence Mission. Each of Aksungur’s wings has three pylons. From the inside out, they’re rated to carry loads weighing 500, 300, and 150 kg. Aksungur’s weapon options, according to TAI’s official page, include the MAM-L, MAM-C, Cirit, L-UMTAS, TEBER-81, TEBER-82, KGK-82, HGK-3, and the Miniature Bomb. Until now, the Aksungur drone has flown with 12 MAM-Ls in August 2020. Furthermore, Aksungur tested the TEBER-82 guidance kit developed by Roketsan for Mk-82 type general purpose bombs and the KGK-S?HA-82 developed by TUBITAK SAGE.

Options have included either a modernized F135 “Enhanced Engine Package” or an advanced engine from AETP, which would provide substantial increases in performance and efficiency.\nEngines from AETP are likely to power the Air Force’s planned sixth-generation fighter, the Next Generation Air Dominance platform. But both Congress and the Air Force has expressed an interest in getting those engines on the F-35 as well—lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring such a change starting in 2027, and Kendall said early in his tenure that he’d like to do so if it’s affordable.\nThat, however, has been a major sticking point. The Joint Program Office has made clear that any member of the F-35 program that wants to be “different” has to pay the full cost for that, which would include the development and integration of the AETP engines.\nIt’s unclear whether the Navy, the Marine Corps, or any of the other nations in the F-35 program are interested in splitting the costs of such an effort with the Air Force. GE Aviation, the maker of one of the AETP engines, has said its engine wouldn’t be able to go in the Marines’ F-35Bs, though it would fit on the Navy’s F-35Cs.\nNone of the other services or partners have agreed on the need for the AETP engine, Kendall confirmed to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n“Each of the services and each of our partners is in a different situation with regard to the economics of doing that and the performance requirements,” Kendall said. “We have the largest fleet in the Air Force—we will have the largest fleet. So we have the greatest interest in this, I think, but there’s a significant cost associated with a brand new engine, development of that. It’s less expensive to do an upgrade, perhaps, and get increased performance, and then there are other options in between.”\nWith so many different perspectives and needs to juggle, Kendall said that the Office of the Secretary of Defense will need to make a final call on any changes, seemingly hinting that the Air Force won’t look to “go it alone” with their own separate effort.\n“The Department of Defense has to make a decision overall about engine modifications and upgrades for the F-35.

The US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provides the upper tier of a multilayered missile defense system and is capable of intercepting missiles at altitudes of 40-150 km in their terminal phase.\nBut South Korea has particularly strived to build up homegrown middle and upper-tier missile defenses — which have not yet developed — against mounting North Korean missile threats.\n“The long-range surface-to-air missile, L-SAM, is a weapon system that intends to intercept missiles at higher altitudes than the Cheongung II, and we have been conducting flight tests of guided missiles and missile interception tests aiming to complete system development by 2024,” Eom said.\n“Our goal is to mass produce and deploy the L-SAM within two to three years after system development is completed in 2024.”\nThe L-SAM has been developed to shoot down hostile missiles at altitudes between 50 and 60 km, and then South Korea plans to upgrade the L-SAM to the L-SAM 2.\n“A pilot research on the L-SAM 2 has been underway,” Eom said. “If a series of the L-SAM (1 and 2) is deployed, we expect multilayered missile defense systems in the South Korean airspace will be further strengthened.”\nSouth Korea also seeks to precipitate the deployment of the Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system, which is analogous to Israel’s “Iron Dome” interceptor, in the capital and densely populated areas. The plan aims to counter threats posed by North Korea’s artillery and multiple rocket launchers.\n“We’ve carried out policy tasks including expeditious deployment of the long-range artillery interception system in order to strengthen the South Korean military’s system to counter threats posed by North Korea’s long-range artillery to the capital area,” Eom said.\n“The government has put efforts to reduce the time required to develop and deploy long-range artillery interceptor systems by minimizing administrative lead time and securing core technologies in advance before starting research and development in earnest.”\nSouth Korea commenced “exploratory development” of long-range artillery interceptor systems this year.\nEyes, ears on battlefield\nEom underscored the importance of South Korea’s efforts to domestically secure “cutting-edge military technologies” to complete the homegrown three-axis defense system.\nSouth Korea has pursued locally developing technologies for “surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control which is yet insufficient” to build the Kill Chain system, according to Eom.\nLocally developing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities is essential to complete the Kill Chain system.\nThe Kill Chain — which is the first axis of South Korea’s homegrown three-pronged defense system — intends to detect, locate and select enemy targets for action. The system therefore enables South Korea to conduct a preemptive attack against the enemy in case of contingency scenarios.\n“We also endeavor to develop independent ISR capabilities in multiple domains from space to ground,” Eom said, admitting South Korea’s high dependence on the US’ ISR assets.\n“In space, a project to develop military reconnaissance satellites (the 425 project) — which is the core of the Kill Chain system — has been underway without a hitch. If satellites are deployed by 2025 after conducting tests and evaluations beginning from 2023, it will contribute to improving our military’s independent surveilling capabilities.”\nIn the air, high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (HUAVs), airborne early warning and control aircraft and Baekdu reconnaissance aircraft have been deployed and monitored the entire Korean Peninsula.\nEom said South Korea is set to mass produce homegrown medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs). Testing and evaluation of the reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle-II to be operated by corps-level units have been in progress.\nOn the ground, South Korea has operated Green Pine anti-ballistic missile radars to detect and track ballistic missiles while “researching and developing a project to replace imported, obsolete long-range radars.”\nSouth Korea plans to begin to deploy first locally developed long-range radars from 2026, according to Eom.\nSouth Korea’s long-range radars will monitor and detect targets including aircraft in the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) and send data to the Air Force’s Master Control and Reporting Center for air defense. At the MCRC, the Air Force monitors the South and North Korean airspace around the clock and controls and commands all aircraft flying over the Korean Peninsula as well as air defense assets.\nIn addition, South Korea plans to commence the development of a microsatellite system this December and put dozens of microsatellites in clusters into orbit by 2030.\nEom underlined that the interconnected operation of military spy satellites and ultrasmall satellite constellations will reduce revisit times for satellites, which is the time interval between observations of the same location on Earth by satellites.\n“South Korea’s surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities will be improved if the country can shorten revisit times over the Korean Peninsula by operating high-performance military reconnaissance satellites and microsatellite systems in a complementary manner.”\nEom explained that the DAPA has actively pushed forward various projects, including the 425 project and long-range artillery interception system, to “localize defense and combat systems, setting the goal of localization rate in producing components of each defense project is higher than 70 to 90 percent.”\nKF-21 exports\nThe DAPA head also stressed that South Korea’s first homegrown KF-21 fighter aircraft will “fill the security vacuum by replacing long-running fighter jets and contribute to defending territorial airspace and national security.”\nSouth Korea in July began a long journey of 2,200 test flights that will run until 2026. Around 120 KF-21 fighter jets will be deployed to South Korean Air Force bases by 2032.\nA 4.5th-generation KF-21 Boramae aircraft – which has very low observability compared to a fourth-generation fighter — will be assessed as cut out for the future battlefield, Eom explained, underscoring that KF-21 fighter aircraft will be utilized as the “core combat power of South Korea’s Air Force.”\nEom said South Korea is able to refurbish and upgrade domestic-made KF-21 fighter jets at discretion with proprietary technology, playing up to one of the advantages of domestically developing combat fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea has been running up against certain limitations when it seeks to upgrade imported foreign fighter jets to meet the military’s needs or arm imported fighter jets with domestically produced weapons. Such a process requires permission from a manufacturing country.\n“However, locally developed KF-21 aircraft will enable the development of its derivatives and localization of aircraft equipment and weapons to meet operational needs,” Eom said, adding that KF-21 fighter aircraft can be utilized as a part of a manned-unmanned-teaming (MUM-T) system should South Korea develop unmanned fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea’s KF-21 will also gain a competitive edge against European rivals in the cut-throat global fighter aircraft market, Eom said.\nSouth Korea is bullish on the potential for exporting KF-21 fighter aircraft.\n“KF-21 fighter jet is expected to be competitive against Europe-produced aircraft in terms of aircraft acquisition cost, efficiency of aircraft maintenance and operations and operations and maintenance costs,” Eom said. The operational lifespan of a fighter jet is usually several decades.\nSouth Korea has also gained worldwide recognition for its technology through continuing exports of FA-50 light attack aircraft and T-50 advanced supersonic jet trainers.\n“We expect that KF-21 fighter aircraft will have export competitiveness in countries which plan to operate fourth or 4.5th-generation fighter jets instead of fifth-generation fighters as well as countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that have operated FA/T-50 aircraft,” Eom said.\n“The competitiveness of KF-21 aircraft will be further enhanced in the export market if we develop its ability to operate weapons by continuously developing domestic aircraft weapons and pursuing system integration as well as reduce costs in mass production by increasing production of aircraft.”\n", "中文原文": "首尔还将开发防御和监视系统，以提高军队对朝鲜日益增长的威胁的准备能力。首尔--韩国国家武器采购机构负责人告诉《韩国先驱报》，韩国正在开发国产作战武器、防御和监视系统，以加强军方对日益增长和持续的朝鲜威胁的威慑和准备态势。他说，迅速完成国产三轴防御系统--包括杀伤链先发制人打击机制、韩国空中和导弹防御系统(KAMD)和韩国大规模惩罚和报复系统(KMPR)--对实现这一目标至关重要。国防采办计划管理局(DAPA)部长Eom Dong-hwan在接受采访时说：“政府计划明年推进250项离散任务，包括发展武器系统和国防技术，以确保本土三轴防御系统的能力，加强韩国军方应对朝鲜不断升级的核和导弹威胁的能力。”韩国特别寻求建立一个多层导弹防御系统来完成KAMD，因为朝鲜开发了更有生存能力和机动性的弹道导弹，包括KN-23、KN-24和KN-25短程弹道导弹，以穿透和使导弹防御系统失效。美国制造的爱国者导弹拦截器和国产的清二型导弹--已经部署在韩国--可以在高达40公里的高度对抗来袭的弹道导弹。美国末段高空区域防御(THAAD)系统提供了多层导弹防御系统的上层，能够在导弹末段拦截40-150公里高度的导弹。但韩国特别努力建立尚未发展的国产中上层导弹防御系统，以应对日益增长的朝鲜导弹威胁。Eom说：“远程地对空导弹L-SAM是一种武器系统，旨在拦截比清空II更高海拔的导弹，我们一直在进行导弹飞行测试和导弹拦截测试，旨在到2024年完成系统开发。”“我们的目标是在2024年完成系统开发后的两到三年内量产并部署L-SAM。”L-SAM已经被开发用于击落50至60公里高度的敌对导弹，然后韩国计划将L-SAM升级为L-SAM 2。“关于L-SAM 2的试点研究已经在进行中，”Eom说。“如果一系列L-SAM（1和2）被部署，我们预计韩国领空的多层导弹防御系统将进一步加强。”韩国还寻求在首都和人口稠密地区加快部署低空导弹防御系统(LAMD)，该系统类似于以色列的“铁穹”拦截器。该计划旨在对抗朝鲜火炮和多管火箭炮构成的威胁。“我们已经执行了政策任务，包括快速部署远程火炮拦截系统，以加强韩国军方的系统，应对朝鲜远程火炮对首都地区构成的威胁，”Eom说。“政府已经努力减少开发和部署远程火炮拦截系统所需的时间，方法是在认真开始研发之前，最大限度地减少行政准备时间，并提前确保核心技术的安全。”韩国今年开始了远程火炮拦截系统的“探索性开发”。战场上的眼睛、耳朵Eom强调了韩国努力在国内保护“尖端军事技术”以完成国产三轴防御系统的重要性。据Eom称，韩国一直在当地开发“监视和侦察、指挥和控制技术，但这还不足以”建立杀伤链系统。在当地发展情报、监视、侦察(ISR)能力对完成杀伤链系统至关重要。杀伤链是韩国本土三管齐下防御系统的第一个轴心，旨在探测、定位和选择敌方目标进行行动。因此，该系统使韩国能够在紧急情况下对敌人进行先发制人的攻击。“我们还努力在从太空到地面的多个领域发展独立的ISR能力，”Eom说，承认韩国高度依赖美国的ISR资产。“在太空，一个开发军事侦察卫星的项目（425项目）--这是杀伤链系统的核心--一直在顺利进行。如果从2023年开始进行测试和评估后，到2025年部署卫星，将有助于改善", "中文源标题": "韩国研发国产武器对抗朝鲜威胁", "英文整编": "The head of South Korea's weapons acquisition agency said that South Korea is developing local combat weapons, defense and surveillance systems to enhance the deterrent power of the military and cope with the increasing North Korean threat.

The reduced costs for time, labor, maintenance and energy are expected to accelerate expansion of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.", "原文": "\"The scan speed reduces costs significantly,\" said ORNL lead researcher Amir Ziabari. \"And the quality is higher, so the post-processing analysis becomes much simpler.\"\nThe framework is already being incorporated into software used by commercial partner ZEISS within its machines at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, where companies hone 3D-printing methods.\nORNL researchers had previously developed technology that can analyze the quality of a part while it is being printed. Adding a high level of imaging accuracy after printing provides an additional level of trust in additive manufacturing while potentially increasing production.\n\"With this, we can inspect every single part coming out of 3D-printing machines,\" said Pradeep Bhattad, ZEISS business development manager for additive manufacturing. \"Currently CT is limited to prototyping. But this one tool can propel additive manufacturing toward industrialization.\"\nX-ray CT scanning is important for certifying the soundness of a 3D-printed part without damaging it. The process is similar to medical X-ray CT. In this case, an object set inside a cabinet is slowly rotated and scanned at each angle by powerful X-rays. Computer algorithms use the resulting stack of two-dimensional projections to construct a 3D image showing the density of the object's internal structure. X-ray CT can be used to detect defects, analyze failures or certify that a product matches the intended composition and quality.\nHowever, X-ray CT is not used at large scale in additive manufacturing because current methods of scanning and analysis are time-intensive and imprecise. Metals can totally absorb the lower-energy X-rays in the X-ray beam, creating image inaccuracies that can be further multiplied if the object has a complex shape. The resulting flaws in the image can obscure cracks or pores the scan is intended to reveal. A trained technician can correct for these problems during analysis, but the process is time- and labor-intensive.\nZiabari and his team developed a deep-learning framework that rapidly provides a clearer, more accurate reconstruction and an automated analysis. He will present the process his team developed during the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Image Processing in October.\nTraining a supervised deep-learning network for CT usually requires many expensive measurements. Because metal parts pose additional challenges, getting the appropriate training data can be difficult. Ziabari's approach provides a leap forward by generating realistic training data without requiring extensive experiments to gather it.\nA generative adversarial network, or GAN, method is used to synthetically create a realistic-looking data set for training a neural network, leveraging physics-based simulations and computer-aided design. GAN is a class of machine learning that utilizes neural networks competing with each other as in a game. It has rarely been used for practical applications like this, Ziabari said.\nBecause this X-ray CT framework needs scans with fewer angles to achieve accuracy, it has reduced imaging time by a factor of six, Ziabari said -- from about one hour to 10 minutes or less. Working that quickly with so few viewing angles would normally add significant \"noise\" to the 3D image.

These results were good, and ongoing trials at MDF are working to verify that the technique is equally effective with any type of metal alloy, Bhattad said.\nThat's important, because the approach developed by Ziabari's team could make it far easier to certify parts made from new metal alloys. \"People don't use novel materials because they don't know the best printing parameters,\" Ziabari said. \"Now, if you can characterize these materials so quickly and optimize the parameters, that would help move these novel materials into additive manufacturing.\"\nIn fact, Ziabari said, the technology can be applied in many fields, including defense, auto manufacturing, aerospace and electronics printing, as well as nondestructive evaluation of electric vehicle batteries.\n", "中文原文": "“扫描速度显著降低了成本，”ORNL首席研究员阿米尔·齐亚巴里说。“而且质量更高，所以后期处理分析变得简单多了。”该框架已经被商业合作伙伴蔡司在能源部位于ORNL的制造示范设施的机器中使用的软件集成，公司在那里磨练3D打印方法。ORNL的研究人员以前开发了一种技术，可以在印刷时分析零件的质量。在打印后增加高水平的成像精度提供了附加制造的额外信任水平，同时潜在地增加产量。蔡司增材制造业务发展经理普拉迪普·巴塔德（Pradeep Bhattad）表示：“有了这个，我们可以检查3D打印机的每一个零件。”“目前CT仅限于原型制造。但这一工具可以推动增材制造走向产业化。”X射线CT扫描对于证明3D打印零件的可靠性而不损坏它是很重要的。其过程类似于医用X线CT。在这种情况下，橱柜内的一个物体被缓慢旋转，并被强大的X射线以每个角度扫描。计算机算法使用得到的二维投影堆叠来构造显示物体内部结构密度的3D图像。X射线CT可以用来检测缺陷，分析故障或证明产品符合预期的成分和质量。然而，X射线CT在增材制造中没有得到大规模的应用，因为目前的扫描和分析方法耗时长且不精确。金属可以完全吸收X射线束中的低能量X射线，造成图像不准确，如果物体具有复杂的形状，这种不准确会进一步增加。由此产生的图像缺陷可能会掩盖扫描意图揭示的裂缝或孔隙。一个训练有素的技术人员可以在分析过程中纠正这些问题，但这个过程是费时费力的。Ziabari和他的团队开发了一个深度学习框架，可以快速提供更清晰、更准确的重建和自动化分析。他将在十月份的电气和电子工程师学会图像处理国际会议上介绍他的团队开发的过程。为CT训练一个有监督的深度学习网络通常需要许多昂贵的测量。由于金属部件带来了额外的挑战，获得适当的训练数据可能很困难。Ziabari的方法提供了一个飞跃，它生成了现实的训练数据，而不需要大量的实验来收集数据。一种生成对抗网络或GAN方法被用来综合地创建用于训练神经网络的逼真的数据集，利用基于物理的模拟和计算机辅助设计。GAN是一种机器学习，它利用神经网络相互竞争，就像在游戏中一样。它很少被用于像这样的实际应用，Ziabari说。Ziabari说，由于这种X射线CT框架需要更少角度的扫描才能达到精度，它将成像时间减少了6倍--从大约1小时减少到10分钟或更少。在如此少的视角下快速工作通常会给3D图像增加显著的“噪声”。但是在训练数据上教授的ORNL算法纠正了这一点，甚至将小缺陷检测提高了四倍或更多。Ziabari团队开发的框架将允许制造商快速微调他们的构建，即使在改变设计或材料的同时。Bhattad说，通过这种方法，样本分析可以在一天内完成，而不是六到八周。“如果我能以非常经济有效的方式非常迅速地检查整个部件，那么我们有100%的信心，”他说。“我们正在与ORNL合作，使CT成为一种方便和可靠的行业检查工具。”ORNL的研究人员使用复杂致密的材料，在数百个打印了不同扫描参数的样本上评估了新框架的性能。Bhattad说，这些结果很好，MDF正在进行的试验正在努力验证这项技术对任何类型的金属合金都同样有效。这很重要，因为Ziabari团队开发的方法可以使认证由新金属合金制成的零件变得更加容易。“人们不使用新颖的材料，因为他们不知道最好的印刷参数，”齐亚巴里说。“现在，如果你能这么快地表征这些材料并优化参数，这将有助于将这些新材料转移到增材制造领域。”Ziabari说，事实上，该技术可应用于多个领域，包括国防、汽车制造、航空航天和电子印刷，以及电动汽车电池的无损评估。", "中文源标题": "能源部橡树岭国家实验室开发的一种新的深度学习框架正在加快使用X射线计算机断层扫描或CT检查额外制造的金属零件的过程，同时提高结果的准确性。时间、劳动力、维护和能源成本的降低预计将加速增材制造或3D打印的扩张。", "英文整编": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory of the US Department of Energy has developed a new deep learning framework, which can speed up the process of X-ray computed tomography (CT) detection of metal parts manufactured by additives, reduce time, manpower and energy costs and improve accuracy.X-ray CT scanning can scan and analyze the internal structure of 3D printed components without damaging them, and can be used to detect defects, analyze faults or prove that the product quality meets expectations.

It is often necessary for technicians to correct it in the analysis process, which is time-consuming and laborious, and hinders the large-scale use of CT in additive manufacturing.Therefore, the research team adopted the machine learning method of Generating Countermeasure Network (GAN) to create real CT training data, thus shortening the imaging time by 6 times, improving the accuracy of small defect detection by more than 4 times, and shortening the analysis time of 3D printed samples from 6-8 weeks to 1 day.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve this goal. They have developed a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that generates synthetic images with high spatial resolution from lower resolution brain MRI scans.\nThe convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, known as LF-SynthSR, converts low-field-strength (0.064 T) T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI sequences into isotropic images with 1 mm spatial resolution and the appearance of a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) acquisition. Describing their proof-of-concept study in Radiology, the researchers report that the synthetic images exhibited high correlation with images acquired by 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners.\nPrincipal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\nMorphometry, the quantitative size and shape analysis of structures in an image, is central to many neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, most MRI analysis tools are designed for near-isotropic, high-resolution acquisitions and typically require T1-weighted images such as MP-RAGE. Their performance often drops rapidly as voxel size and anisotropy increase. As the vast majority of existing clinical MRI scans are highly anisotropic, they cannot be reliably analysed with existing tools.\n“Millions of low-resolution brain MR images are produced every year, but currently cannot be analysed with neuroimaging software,” explains principal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias. “The main goal of my current research is to develop algorithms that make low-resolution brain MR images look like the high-resolution MRI scans that we use in research. I am particularly interested in two applications: enabling automated 3D analysis of the clinical scans and use with portable, low-field MRI scanners.”\nTraining and testing\nLF-SynthSR is built upon SynthSR, a method developed by the team to train a CNN to predict 1 mm-resolution MP-RAGE isotropic scans from routine clinical MR scans. Previous findings reported in NeuroImage showed that SynthSR-generated images could be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration and, if some quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.\nBoth LF-SynthSR and SynthSR are trained on synthetic input images of highly varying appearance generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrast, resolution and orientation.\nIglesias points out that neural networks perform best when data appear approximately constant, but every hospital uses scanners from different vendors that are configured differently, resulting in highly heterogeneous scans. “To tackle this problem, we are borrowing ideas from a field of machine learning called ‘domain randomization’, where you train neural networks with synthetic images that are simulated to constantly change appearance and resolution, in order to obtain trained networks that are agnostic to the appearance of the input images,” he explains.\nTo assess the performance of LF-SynthSR, the researchers correlated brain morphology measurements between synthetic MRIs and ground-truth high-field strength images. For training, they used a high-field-strength MRI dataset of 1-mm isotropic MP-RAGE scans from 20 subjects. They also used corresponding segmentations of 36 brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) and three extracerebral ROIs. The training set was also artificially augmented to better model pathologic tissue such as stroke or haemorrhage.\nThe test set comprised imaging data from 24 participants with neurological symptoms who had a low-field strength (0.064 T) scan in addition to a standard-of-care high-field strength (1.5–3 T) MRI. The algorithm successfully generated 1-mm isotropic synthetic MP-RAGE images from the low-field strength brain MRIs, with voxels more than 10 times smaller than in the original data. Automated segmentation of the synthetic images from a final sample of 11 participants yielded ROI volumes that were highly correlated with those derived from the high-field strength MR scans.\n“LF-SynthSR may improve the image quality of low-field strength MRI scans to the point that they are usable not only by automated segmentation methods but potentially also with registration and classification algorithms,” the researchers write. “It could also be used to augment the detection of abnormal lesions.”\nThis ability to analyse low-resolution brain MRIs using automated morphometry would enable the study of rare diseases and populations that are under-represented in current neuroimaging research. In addition, improving the quality of images from portable MRI scanners would enhance their use in medically underserved areas, as well as in critical care, where moving patients to an MRI suite is often too risky.\nIglesias says that another challenge is the wide range of abnormalities found in clinical scans that need to be handled by the CNN. “Currently, SynthSR works well with healthy brains, cases with atrophy, and smaller abnormalities like small multiple sclerosis lesions or small strokes,” he tells Physics World. “We are currently working to improve the method so it can effectively deal with larger lesions, like larger strokes or tumours.”\nWriting in an accompanying editorial in Radiology, Birgit Ertl-Wagner and Matthias Wagner from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto comment: “This exciting technical development study demonstrates the potential to go low on field strength and aim high for spatial and contrast resolution using artificial intelligence.”\n", "中文原文": "便携式低场强MRI系统具有改变神经成像的潜力--前提是它们的低空间分辨率和低信噪比可以被克服。哈佛医学院的研究人员正在利用人工智能(AI)来实现这一目标。他们开发了一种机器学习超分辨率算法，可以从低分辨率的大脑MRI扫描中生成高空间分辨率的合成图像。卷积神经网络(CNN)算法LF-SynthSR将低场强(0.064T)T1和T2加权脑MRI序列转换为空间分辨率为1 mm的各向同性图像，并显示出T1加权磁化准备快速梯度回波（MP-RAGE）采集。在描述他们在放射学中的概念验证研究时，研究人员报告说，合成图像与1.5T和3.0T MRI扫描仪获得的图像显示出高度相关性。马萨诸塞州总医院和哈佛医学院的首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯。形态计量学是对图像中结构的定量大小和形状分析，是许多神经影像学研究的核心。不幸的是，大多数MRI分析工具是为近各向同性、高分辨率采集而设计的，通常需要T1加权图像，如MP-RAGE。它们的性能往往随着体素尺寸和各向异性的增加而迅速下降。由于绝大多数现有的临床MRI扫描是高度各向异性的，它们不能用现有的工具进行可靠的分析。首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯解释说：“每年产生数百万张低分辨率脑部磁共振图像，但目前无法用神经成像软件进行分析。”“我目前研究的主要目标是开发算法，使低分辨率大脑MR图像看起来像我们在研究中使用的高分辨率MRI扫描。我对两个应用特别感兴趣：实现临床扫描的自动化三维分析和便携式低场MRI扫描仪的使用。“培训和测试LF-SynthSR是建立在SynthSR的基础上的，这是一种由该小组开发的方法，用于训练CNN从常规临床MR扫描中预测1毫米分辨率的MP-RAGE各向同性扫描。先前在NeuroImage上报道的发现表明，SynthSR生成的图像可以可靠地用于皮层下分割和体积测量、图像配准，如果满足某些质量要求，甚至可以用于皮层厚度形态测量。LF-SynthSR和SynthSR都是在从3D分割产生的高度变化外观的合成输入图像上训练的，因此可以用于训练CNNs的对比度、分辨率和方向的任何组合。Iglesias指出，当数据看起来近似恒定时，神经网络表现最好，但每家医院使用来自不同供应商的扫描仪，这些扫描仪的配置不同，导致扫描高度异构。他解释说：“为了解决这个问题，我们借鉴了一个名为‘领域随机化’的机器学习领域的思想，在这个领域中，你用模拟的合成图像来训练神经网络，以不断改变外观和分辨率，从而获得对输入图像的外观不可知的训练网络。”为了评估LF-SynthSR的性能，研究人员将合成MRIs和地面高场强图像之间的大脑形态测量进行了关联。为了训练，他们使用了来自20名受试者的1毫米各向同性MP-RAGE扫描的高场强MRI数据集。他们还使用了36个脑感兴趣区和3个脑外感兴趣区的相应分段。训练集还被人工增强，以更好地模拟病理组织，如中风或出血。该测试集包括24名有神经症状的参与者的影像学数据，他们除了接受标准护理高场强(1.5-3T)MRI之外，还接受了低场强(0.064T)扫描。该算法成功地从低场强脑磁共振成像中生成了1-mm各向同性合成MP-RAGE图像，体素比原始数据小10倍以上。对来自11名参与者的最终样本的合成图像进行自动分割，得到的ROI体积与高场强MR扫描的结果高度相关。研究人员写道：“LF-SynthSR可能会改善低场强MRI扫描的图像质量，以至于它们不仅可以通过自动分割方法使用，还可能通过配准和分类算法使用。”“它还可以用来加强异常病变的检测.”这种使用自动形态计量分析低分辨率脑部磁共振成像的能力将使研究罕见疾病和在当前神经成像研究中未得到充分体现的人群成为可能。此外，提高便携式MRI扫描仪的图像质量将提高其在医疗服务不足的地区以及重症监护中的应用", "中文源标题": "人工智能从低场强磁共振扫描中创建高分辨率大脑图像", "英文整编": "Recently, Harvard Medical School has achieved the goal of overcoming the low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system by using artificial intelligence technology.

Germany selected the missile to meet its Leichtes Wirkmittel 1800+ requirement.\nThe Enforcer shoulder launched weapon system provides low-collateral precision effects capabilities against the threat from lightly armoured static and moving targets, targets behind cover, and against targets at long range also in urban environments. Enforcer is a 2km-class disposable shoulder-launched guided munition, which provides stand-off capability for forces while engaging targets on the battlefield. The missile weighs less than 7kg and the system along with sight and two munitions weighs less than 20kg. The combined weight of the missile and the launch tube is less than 9kg. The weapon can engage targets within the range between 1,000m and 2,000m. The compact size and dimension of the missile make it more efficient and easier to carry and use in asymmetrical conflict zones.\nEnforcer possesses increased capabilities than the existing infantry weapon systems. The missile is equipped with a lock-on before launch (LOBL) feature. The fire-and-forget missile has the capability to destroy lightly-armoured and soft-skinned targets. It is also effective against hidden targets due to its airburst capabilities. The weapon system has been designed to have the lowest possible collateral damage, and can be easily operable by a single soldier. The missile’s seeker head guides it directly to the centre of the predetermined target. Enforcer has the capacity to perform day and night operations and displays firing capability in enclosed spaces. It carries a multi-effect warhead that can hit targets with high precision over full range.\nThe modular design of the Enforcer system enables a range of future development options, including a prospective ‘family’ of Enforcer munitions for land, air and sea applications. The shoulder-launched Enforcer missile serves as a basis for a new air-launched variant called Enforcer Air. Enforcer Air was unveiled at the Berlin Security Conference 2019 held in Berlin, in November 2019. Enforcer Air has been developed by MBDA Deutschland. It comes with various launching options including drop-launched, tube-launched and rail-launched. The missile can be carried by helicopters, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and medium-latitude long-endurance (MALE) UAVs. The air-launched missile is primarily being offered to Germany.\n", "中文原文": "MBDA在国防和安全设备国际(DSEI)2021上展示了强制者轻量级高精度导弹系统。MBDA在完成演示方案后，于2014年开始开发强制者紧凑型导弹系统。在德国领导的多国MBDA项目下开发的Enforcer是MBDA最大的自筹资金项目之一。开发阶段包括2016年11月在德国联邦国防军武器弹药技术中心91进行的多次制导射击。2019年12月，MBDA与德国签署了一项合同，为德国武装部队提供强制者导弹系统。德国选择这种导弹是为了满足其Leichtes Wirkmittel 1800+的要求。强制者肩部发射武器系统提供了低附带精度效果的能力，以对抗来自轻装甲静态和移动目标、掩护后目标的威胁，以及城市环境中的远程目标。强制者是一种2km级一次性肩射制导弹药，为部队在战场上与目标交战时提供对峙能力。导弹重量不到7千克，系统连同瞄准具和两枚弹药重量不到20千克。导弹和发射管的总重量不到9千克。该武器可以与1000米至2000米范围内的目标交战。这种导弹的体积和尺寸紧凑，使其在不对称的冲突地区更有效、更易于携带和使用。强制者拥有比现有步兵武器系统更大的能力。该导弹配备了发射前锁定(LOBL)功能。发射-忘记导弹有能力摧毁轻装甲和软皮肤目标。由于它的空袭能力，它对隐藏目标也很有效。该武器系统被设计为具有尽可能低的附带伤害，并且可以很容易地由一名士兵操作。导弹的导引头直接将其引导到预定目标的中心。强制者有能力执行白天和夜间的行动，并在封闭的空间中显示发射能力。它携带一个多效弹头，可以在全射程内高精度打击目标。强制执行器系统的模块化设计使未来的一系列发展选择成为可能，包括未来的“家庭”强制执行器弹药用于陆地、空中和海上应用。肩射强制者导弹是一种新的空中发射变体的基础，称为强制者空中。Enforcer Air于2019年11月在柏林举行的2019年柏林安全会议上亮相。强制空气已开发的MBDA德国。它有各种发射选择，包括下降发射，管状发射和铁路发射。该导弹可由直升机、战术无人机和中纬度长航时(MALE)无人机携带。这种空射导弹主要是提供给德国的。", "中文源标题": "MBDA在DSEI展示强制者轻型高精度导弹系统", "英文整编": "MBDA, a European multinational missile manufacturer, demonstrated the shoulder-mounted Enforcer high-precision missile system at the 2021 International Exhibition of Defense and Security Equipment (DSEI).Shoulder-mounted Enforcer missile system has low collateral damage precision strike capability, which can attack static and mobile light armored targets within 1000 meters to 2000 meters, targets behind bunkers and long-distance targets in urban environment, and can provide troops with out-of-zone defense capability while engaging battlefield targets.

The National Defense Industrial Association is raising concerns about the defense-industrial base's health. (Lockheed Martin)\nWASHINGTON ― Lawmakers voiced worries on Wednesday about the health of the defense-industrial base in a House hearing where trade leaders said spending volatility and red tape make it tough for industry to surge capacity.\nAmid broader discussions in the House about potential Pentagon budget cuts, members of the House Armed Services Committee offered a sympathetic forum for the defense sector as important to national security and an economic engine. For their part, leaders with the Aerospace Industries Association, National Defense Industrial Association and Shipbuilders Council of America said industry would respond best to stable demand from government.\n“We cannot prevail in any conflict without a ready, strong and adaptable industrial base. Yet the defense-industrial base is experiencing a multitude of challenges,” said the panel’s chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala. “Some of these include inflation, workforce shortages, bureaucratic hurdles and supply chains that remain too dependent on foreign sources of materials.”\nAmid calls from industry for the administration to adjust otherwise firm-fixed-price contracts to account for inflation, Rogers said the administration “refuses to use the authorities and resources Congress gave them last year to provide necessary relief.”\nIndustry representatives at the hearing said the lack of adjustments hurts companies by depressing wages as the sector grapples with worker shortfalls.\nThe hearing was the second for the committee under the new Republican-led House. It comes amid concerns that Ukraine’s consumption of U.S.-supplied materiel is outstripping the capacity of American defense firms to quickly replenish it ― a negative sign as the U.S seeks to deter China.\nAsked about a Center for Strategic and International Studies report last month that found the U.S. defense-industrial base is unprepared for a notional battle with China over Taiwan, Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Eric Fanning said wavering demand stymies efforts to stockpile munitions or surge.\n“To have that capability to surge requires a consistent, long-term [government funding] commitment,” Fanning said, adding that some suppliers have become skittish about multiyear contracts, given the specter of inflation eating into profits.\nDespite growing U.S. defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the defense industry has signaled it won’t expand capacity without a firmer commitment from the government. The trade group chiefs lamented what they saw as overregulation, inconsistent defense spending and bureaucratic barriers for small business. They said uncertainty about Congress raising the debt limit adds a tricky variable.\n“Unfortunately, over the last several years industry has also experienced an unpredictable budget and volatile acquisition environment with repeated shifts in fleet-size [plans] that make [industry’s] CAPEX, or facility, decisions more difficult,” said Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America. “The most effective mechanism to ensure the industrial base is stable and resilient is through consistent demand and adequate funding.”\nThe panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith, argued that, given industry’s reluctance to increase its manufacturing capacity without a sustained commitment from the government, the U.S. will have to target investments to where it needs arms quickly and in large quantities.\n“We need to figure out what do we really need in the industrial base. You’re not going to be able to prepare for every conceivable contingency; we just don’t have the resources, and the private sector will not make that investment on a wish and a promise,” said Smith of Washington. “We need to be really strategic about it.”\nBoth Rogers and Smith voiced concern with the U.S. defense-industrial base’s reliance on China for critical minerals and semiconductors. Smith suggested that deeper industrial ties with allied nations and opportunities for smaller, innovative defense firms offer potential fixes.\nFanning echoed those concerns and suggested the government provide seed funding to take back a share of critical mineral processing, which China dominates. “It’s an issue for the federal government to help create that market, which is not easy to do,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, the National Defense Industrial Association released its annual report on the state of the U.S. defense-industrial base, which said indicators for industrial base readiness are trending in the wrong direction: The size of America’s defense workforce shrunk to 1.1 million from 3 million in 1985; in five years more than 17,000 companies stopped working in the defense sector; and defense spending as a share of the economy fell 45%.\nAt the hearing, the association’s president and CEO, David Norquist, said among the hindrances are fixed-price contracts that lock in labor rates and growing lags in the government’s security clearance process for private-sector workers.\nHe also suggested using immigration policies to grow the country’s pool of science and technology experts.\nLast week, the head of Naval Sea Systems Command said its “No. 1 strategic challenge” is hiring and retaining skilled workers, as the Navy and its suppliers have thousands of open jobs at government repair yards and in the private shipbuilding and ship repair sectors.\nRep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, noted that the Pentagon’s budget plan calls for $1.6 billion in long-term investment in the Columbia-class nuclear submarine’s workforce, supply chain and facilities.\nThis prompted Paxton to say that sort of demand signal does get “bang for the buck.”\nAbout Joe Gould\nJoe Gould is the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

Led by Sayeef Salahuddin at the University of California, Berkeley, the team based their design around an ultrathin superlattice heterostructure, containing alternating layers of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials. The team says that its superlattice could be easily integrated into existing transistor designs, reducing their energy requirements.\nAs modern computers grow ever more powerful, the energy they consume is also growing with seemingly no end in sight. Slowing this trend will require fundamental changes to traditional transistor designs.\nMetal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are ubiquitous in computers and other electronics. They comprise a silicon semiconductor channel through which current can flow between two electrodes. The current flows past a third electrode called the gate, which is separated from the semiconductor channel by an insulating oxide layer. The gate electrode acts like one plate of a capacitor and by varying the voltage applied to the gate, the electronic properties of the silicon can be adjusted. The result is that the current flowing through the channel can be switched on and off.\nOpposite effect\nIn their study, Salahuddin’s team sought to improve this design by exploiting negative capacitance. This an effect that Salahuddin first predicted in 2008 and demonstrated experimentally in 2011. It occurs when a decrease in the voltage across a capacitor results in an increase in the charge stored in the device – the opposite of what happens in conventional capacitors.\nNegative capacitance arises in ferroelectric materials, whose spontaneous electric polarization can be reoriented with the application of an external electric field. To create negative capacitance, an insulating dielectric material is paired with a ferroelectric material – significantly amplifying the amount of charge that accumulates in a ferroelectric material at a given voltage.\nSalahuddin and colleagues have now demonstrated the effect in a new, ultra-thin superlattice material. It comprises alternating, atom-thick layers of the strongly dielectric, ferroelectric material, hafnium dioxide and the antiferroelectric compound zirconium dioxide – which displays zero spontaneous polarization.\nPerformance matching\nTo test their material’s capabilities, the researchers deposited a film of the superlattice just 2 nm thick onto a thin glass layer – separating from it from a silicon layer. In the resulting MOSFET, the team found that the gate voltage could be reduced by about 30%, which reduces the energy consumption of the device. The resulting device was able to match the performance of existing transistor designs.\nSince hafnium dioxide is already widely used in combination with silicon dioxide to form the insulating layers in MOSFETs, this design is highly compatible with existing manufacturing processes. As a result, Salahuddin and colleagues hope that their material could substantially reduce the amount of energy consumed by modern computers, without sacrificing their speed, performance, or small size.\nThe research is described in Nature.\n", "中文原文": "通过利用一种叫做负电容的奇怪效应，研究人员设计了一种晶体管，所需的栅极电压比传统设计低约30%。由加州大学伯克利分校的Sayeef Salahuddin领导的团队基于超薄超晶格异质结构进行设计，该异质结构包含交替的铁电和反铁电材料层。该团队表示，它的超晶格可以很容易地集成到现有的晶体管设计中，降低它们的能量需求。随着现代计算机变得越来越强大，它们消耗的能量也在增长，似乎看不到尽头。减缓这一趋势将需要对传统晶体管设计进行根本性的改变。金属氧化物半导体场效应晶体管（MOSFET）在计算机和其他电子设备中普遍存在。它们包括一个硅半导体通道，电流可以通过该通道在两个电极之间流动。电流流过称为栅极的第三个电极，该电极由绝缘氧化物层与半导体沟道隔开。栅电极的作用就像电容器的一块板，通过改变施加在栅上的电压，硅的电子特性可以被调节。其结果是流过通道的电流可以接通和断开。适得其反的效果在他们的研究中，Salahuddin的团队试图通过利用负电容来改进这种设计。这是萨拉赫丁在2008年首次预测并在2011年进行实验证明的效果。当电容器两端的电压降低导致存储在器件中的电荷增加时，它就会发生--这与传统电容器的情况相反。铁电材料中存在负电容，在外加电场作用下，铁电材料的自发电极化可以重新定向。为了产生负电容，绝缘介质材料与铁电材料配对--在给定电压下显著放大铁电材料中积累的电荷量。Salahuddin和他的同事现在已经在一种新的超薄超晶格材料中证明了这种效应。它由强介电铁电材料、二氧化铪和显示零自发极化的反铁电化合物二氧化锆组成，原子厚的交替层。性能匹配为了测试他们材料的性能，研究人员在一层薄玻璃层上沉积了一层仅2纳米厚的超晶格薄膜--与硅层隔开。在由此产生的MOSFET中，团队发现栅极电压可以降低约30%，这降低了器件的能耗。由此产生的器件能够与现有晶体管设计的性能相匹配。由于二氧化铪与二氧化硅结合在MOSFET中已经被广泛用于形成绝缘层，该设计与现有的制造工艺高度兼容。因此，Salahuddin和他的同事们希望他们的材料能在不牺牲速度、性能或小尺寸的情况下，大幅降低现代计算机消耗的能量。这项研究在《自然》杂志上有描述。", "中文源标题": "负电容可以使晶体管更节能", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a more energy-saving transistor.

The laser, DE M-SHORAD, is designed to shoot down enemy drones and artillery shells.\nIf the laser is successful, it could enter service as early as 2022.\nThe U.S. Army is finally putting a laser weapon on the ground.\nThe Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) system is designed to shoot down not only drones, but also incoming artillery, which has been a vexing problem on the battlefield for hundreds of years. The Army is set to field the first four lasers, mounted to armored vehicles, sometime next year.\nOver the summer, the Army tested DE M-SHORAD at Fort Bliss, home of the service's air defense artillery branch in Texas. The system uses a 50-kilowatt laser weapon system to concentrate a beam of focused laser light at a drone, heating the surface of its skin. In turn, this can cause aerodynamic failure, blind the drone's sensors, disable the engine, or even detonate the fuel supply or explosive payload.\nThis is useful, considering drone attacks are one of the most urgent issues that the Army is currently facing. Small, fast, and capable of carrying a lethal payload, the drone threat has quickly escalated from jury-rigged hobbyist drones to military-grade weapons capable of autonomously engaging enemy troops.\nAlthough the U.S. Army is the most dominant ground force in the world, it was not prepared for this threat, and has scrambled to catch up. DE M-SHORAD—the first Army ground laser weapon—is an outgrowth of this effort. The service plans to mount the laser weapons on Stryker infantry armored vehicles sometime in fiscal year 2022.\nAnother major capability of DE M-SHORAD is the ability to shoot down enemy artillery. For more than a century, the only way ground forces could respond to enemy rockets, mortars, and artillery shells was to dig in, move to another position, or attack the artillery directly. DE M-SHORAD, t he Army claims, can now intercept those munitions in mid- flight, preventing them from landing among friendly troops.\nThe Army has four DE M-SHORAD vehicles, but if the system works as planned, it will almost certainly buy dozens more. The service has nothing else like it for engaging enemy drones and artillery, and it has ten combat divisions and several separate brigades and regiments to protect.

That is a requirement for the program. And that will support our ability to deliver the number of aircraft we need to truly perform the missions that are outlined in the National Defense Strategy,” he said.\nThe program kicked off 12 years ago with a requirement for 100 aircraft at a cost of $550 million each in 2010 dollars. Officials say the current per-aircraft cost is classified, but with a cumulative rate of inflation of 36.7 percent, that comes to $751 million per aircraft in 2022 dollars.\nMaintaining steady numbers is critical to the Air Force as it divvies up funding for its own needs and engages in the yearly food fight with the Navy, Army and Marine Corps for finite taxpayer dollars to fund their priorities.\nAnd there will be many budget battles in the coming years that will put pressure on the B-21 program.\nJet fighters have their own advocates within the Air Force, which is trying to build out its F-35A Lightning II, field the F-15EX, maintain its legacy fleets and develop a sixth-generation Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.\nBombers are part of the nuclear triad along with submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nAll three are being modernized and replaced with completely new systems over the next decade, with the Air Force in charge of the Ground-Based Nuclear Deterrent ICBMs as well as upgrading the nuclear command and control infrastructure that ties the triad together. The Navy is building 12 Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines.\nMeanwhile, the Navy’s ultimate goal is to operate as many as 372 ships, the Army has a big modernization push and the Marines are retooling for 21st century conflicts in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn short, the B-21 Raider will have a lot of competition for Defense Department dollars over the next decade.\nAnd cutting the 100 number is no solution, as retired Air Force Col. Chris “Jekyll” Brunner, senior resident fellow for airpower studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, succinctly put it in a recent podcast.\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which Northrop Grumman also developed and manufactured, shows how the Air Force ended up with a $2 billion apiece aircraft, he said.\nThe service was supposed to acquire 132 B-2s, but out-of-control costs and the end of the Cold War prompted Congress to cut their numbers.\nThat put the program in a death spiral.\nBrunner said cutting aircraft numbers is counter-intuitive. “It increases the cost of the aircraft because you don’t have a large enough fleet to spread costs over, so it makes it incredibly hard to modernize and sustain, driving up bills.

They are being modernized, returning to the factory to be refurbished and updated every nine years.\nBut what of the Sprit’s eventual fate? If history is any guide, the Air Force will eventually build enough B-21s to the point where it will want to retire the B-2 and probably its predecessors, the B-1 Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress.\nBut Congress won’t allow it — finding some way to rationalize their existence — sticking the Air Force with ever-higher bills to sustain aging aircraft in the name of keeping jobs in their districts.\n", "中文原文": "空军的B-21突袭机旨在战胜强大的防空系统，向敌人领土深处的目标运送精确武器，并将其两名机组人员安全送回家园。但随着该计划的推进，一个更大的挑战是，该计划能否在国防部每年的资金争夺战中获胜，降低成本，并交付空军所说的保持其对对手的优势所需的100架飞机。空军和诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的官员在加州棕榈谷举行的B-21推出仪式上，不仅对该计划目前的成本，而且对未来需要多少资金做出了乐观的评估。空军负责采购、技术和后勤的副部长安德鲁·亨特告诉记者，到目前为止，该计划在成本和时间表上“跟踪良好”。“这个项目的一个关键方面是，我们有一个非常明确的成本目标。这是程序的要求。这将支持我们交付所需飞机数量的能力，以真正执行国防战略中概述的任务，“他说。该项目始于12年前，当时需要100架飞机，以2010年美元计算，每架成本为5.5亿美元。官员们表示，目前每架飞机的成本是分类的，但随着36.7%的累计通货膨胀率，以2022年美元计算，每架飞机的成本为7.51亿美元。保持稳定的数字对空军至关重要，因为它为自己的需求分配资金，并与海军、陆军和海军陆战队进行年度粮食斗争，以有限的纳税人资金资助他们的优先事项。未来几年将有许多预算之争，这将给B-21计划带来压力。喷气式战斗机在空军内部有自己的倡导者，空军正试图建造F-35A闪电II，部署F-15EX，保持其遗留机队，并开发第六代下一代空中优势战斗机。轰炸机与潜艇和洲际弹道导弹一起是核三位一体的一部分。未来十年，这三个系统都将现代化，并被全新的系统取代，空军负责地面核威慑洲际弹道导弹，并升级将这三个系统联系在一起的核指挥和控制基础设施。海军正在建造12艘哥伦比亚级弹道导弹核潜艇。与此同时，海军的最终目标是操作多达372艘船只，陆军正在大力推进现代化，海军陆战队正在为21世纪印度-太平洋的冲突进行重组。简而言之，B-21突袭机在未来十年将面临国防部资金的大量竞争。米切尔航空航天研究所航空动力研究高级常驻研究员、退役空军上校克里斯·杰基尔·布伦纳（Chris“Jekyll”Brunner）在最近的一个播客中简明扼要地指出，削减100个数字不是解决办法。他说，诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司也开发和制造的B-2幽灵隐形轰炸机表明，空军最终是如何获得每架20亿美元的飞机的。该服务本应获得132架B-2，但失控的成本和冷战的结束促使国会削减了它们的数量。这使该项目陷入了死亡螺旋。布伦纳说，削减飞机数量是违反直觉的。“这增加了飞机的成本，因为你没有足够大的机队来分散成本，所以这使得现代化和维持变得非常困难，增加了账单。这就是你如何得到一架价值20亿美元的飞机，“他说。他指出，这就是F-35A喷气式战斗机项目今天所面临的困境，因为空军希望每年获得大约72架A型战斗机，但没有达到目标。“从长远来看，你将推高维持成本，因为你没有购买你想要的舰队规模，”他说。“我对B-21最大的恐惧是我们最终会陷入B-2场景，”他说。空军不得不满足于21架B-2飞机--在其中一架坠毁后--现在是20架。它们正在现代化，每九年返回工厂进行翻新和更新。但是精神的最终命运如何呢？如果历史可以作为指导的话，空军最终将建造足够多的B-21，以至于它想让B-2退役，可能还有它的前身，B-1枪骑兵和B-52同温层堡垒。但国会不会允许它--找到某种方式来合理化他们的存在--以保持所在地区的工作为名，用越来越高的账单来维持空军老化的飞机。", "中文源标题": "分析:B-21突袭机的关键数字游戏", "英文整编": "With the advancement of the US Air Force B-21 Raider stealth bomber project, the challenges related to cost control, budget fund acquisition and delivery quantity completion have gradually become prominent.

The Boeing-owned MQ-25 test asset, known as T1, transferred fuel to an E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the newest variant of the E-2 platform which was upgraded with an aerial refueling capability in 2019.\n“Once operational, the MQ-25 will refuel every receiver-capable platformincluding E-2,” said Capt. Chad Reed, the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation (PMA-268) program manager. “This flight keeps us on a fast track to getting the Stingray out to the fleet where its refueling capability will greatly increase the range and operational flexibility of the carrier air wing and strike group.”\nThis test marks the second refueling flight for the MQ-25 program. In June, the government/industry team completed the historic first unmanned tanking flight with an F/A-18 Super Hornet.\nDuring the six-hour flight, Navy E-2D pilots from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Zero (VX) 20 approached T1, performed formation evaluations, wake surveys, drogue tracking and plugs with the MQ-25 test asset at 220 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) and 10,000 feet. This test allows the program to analyze the aerodynamic interaction of the two aircraft. The team can then determine if any adjustments to guidance and control are required and make those software updates early, with no impact to the developmental test schedule.\nT1 testing will continue over the next several months to include flight envelope expansion, engine testing, and deck handling demonstrations aboard an aircraft carrier before the MQ-25 engineering, manufacturing and development aircraft are delivered next year.\n“MQ-25 is leading the way as naval aviation transforms to include cutting-edge unmanned platforms,” said Capt. Michael France, the Navy’s Airborne Command & Control and Logistics Wing (ACCLW) commodore. “Our fleet integration team (FIT)is actively preparing for the Stingray’s arrival and we’re excited for the innovative capabilities of the MQ-25 that will transform our mobility and power projection. For the first time, the eyes and ears of the fleet will now be able to provide up-to-the-minute information from deep within theater to facilitate rapid-decision making by carrier strike group leadership.”\nThe ACCLW will integrate the MQ-25A Stingray into the carrier air wing alongside the E-2 and C-2 squadrons. The Stingray’s persistent mission tanking coupled with the E-2D’s aerial refueling capability will transform the Hawkeye from an over-the-horizon airborne early warning platform limited to shorter missions in the carrier environment, to an asset capable of providing comprehensive battle management for extended periods from anywhere within the battlespace.\nThe MQ-25A FIT is working with PMA-268 and Boeing to ensure the end user(MQ-25 operators)have early input as the aircraft moves quickly from development through test. The Navy will begin standing up the fleet replacement squadron, Unmanned Carrier-Launched Multi Role Squadron (VUQ) 10, later this yearfollowed by two MQ-25A squadrons, VUQ-11 and 12. These squadrons will deploy detachments to the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carriers.\nMQ-25 will be the world’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft and provide critical aerial refueling and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that will greatly expand the global reach, operational flexibility and lethality of the Carrier Air Wing and Carrier Strike Group.

We have submitted data to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) – the World Air Sports Federation who control and certify world aeronautical and astronautical records – that at 15:45 (GMT) on 16 November 2021, the aircraft reached a top speed of 555.9 km/h (345.4 mph) over 3 kilometres, smashing the existing record by 213.04 km/h (132mph). In further runs at the UK Ministry of Defence’s Boscombe Down experimental aircraft testing site, the aircraft achieved 532.1km/h (330 mph) over 15 kilometres – 292.8km/h (182mph) faster than the previous record – and broke the fastest time to climb to 3000 metres by 60 seconds with a time of 202 seconds, according to our data. We hope that the FAI will certify and officially confirm the achievements of the team in the near future.\nDuring its record-breaking runs, the aircraft clocked up a maximum speed of 623 km/h (387.4 mph) which we believe makes the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ the world’s fastest all-electric vehicle.\nWarren East, CEO, Rolls-Royce, said: “Staking the claim for the all-electric world-speed record is a fantastic achievement for the ACCEL team and Rolls-Royce. I would like to thank our partners and especially Electroflight for their collaboration in achieving this pioneering breakthrough. The advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Advanced Air Mobility market. Following the world’s focus on the need for action at COP26, this is another milestone that will help make ‘jet zero’ a reality and supports our ambitions to deliver the technology breakthroughs society needs to decarbonise transport across air, land and sea.”\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “Rolls-Royce’s revolutionary Spirit of Innovation aircraft is yet more proof of the UK’s enviable credentials when it comes to innovation. This record will show the potential of electric flight and help to unlock the technologies that could make it part of everyday life. The government is proud to back projects like this to leverage the private investment necessary to unlock cleaner, greener aircraft which will allow people to fly as they do now, but in a way that cuts emissions.”\nThe ‘Spirit of Innovation’ is part of the ACCEL or ‘Accelerating the Electrification of Flight’ project. Half of the project’s funding is provided by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), in partnership with the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and Innovate UK.\nThe aircraft was propelled on its record breaking runs by a 400kW (500+hp) electric powertrain and the most power-dense propulsion battery pack ever assembled in aerospace. We worked in partnership with aviation energy storage specialist Electroflight and automotive powertrain supplier YASA. As well as a stunning technical achievement, the project and world record runs provided important data for our future electric power and propulsion systems for all-electric urban air mobility and hybrid-electric commuter aircraft.The characteristics that ‘air-taxis’ require from batteries, for instance, are very similar to what was developed for the ‘Spirit of Innovation’.\nStjohn Youngman, Managing Director, Electroflight. “We are delighted to have played an integral role in this landmark project. Its success is a fitting tribute to the dedication and innovation of the Electroflight team and our suppliers. Developing the propulsion and battery system, in collaboration with experienced program partners, has resulted in a world class engineering capability that will lead the way towards the decarbonisation of air travel. Our next step is to adapt this pioneering technology so it can be applied across the wider aerospace industry to deliver a more sustainable way to fly.”\nRolls-Royce has an incredible history of flying speed record attempts and breaking records, dating back to the Schneider Trophies of the early 1930s. The speed achieved by test pilot and Rolls-Royce Director of Flight Operations Phill O’Dell in the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ was more than 213.04 km/h (132 mph) faster than the previous record set by the Siemens eAircraft powered Extra 330 LE Aerobatic aircraft in 2017. Never in the history of the FAI record attempts has there been such a significant increase in speed over such a short time, highlighting the rapid pace at which electrification of aerospace is advancing.\nPhill O’Dell said: “Flying the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ at these incredible speeds and believing we have broken the world-record for all-electric flight is a momentous occasion. This is the highlight of my career and is an incredible achievement for the whole team. The opportunity to be at the forefront of another pioneering chapter of Rolls-Royce’s story as we look to deliver the future of aviation is what dreams are made of.”\nWhile all three organisations share a passionate pioneering spirit, Rolls-Royce through the development process has learnt from the motorsport background of both partners and in particular the pace of start-up Electroflight. Meanwhile we have shared expertise and technology with our partners including the rigorous safety and testing methods needed by the civil aviation industry –this combination has helped turn a concept into a world record breaker.\nDr Tim Woolmer, YASA’s Chief Technology Officer and Founder said, “Electric flight is set to be as transformative for mobility as thejet engine was 70 years ago. It’s thrilling to see our ultra-high performance, super-low weight electric motors powering the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ to these great speeds, and to know that collaborative projects like ACCEL take us one step closer to emissions-free electric flight becoming a commercial realityfor all.”\nThe ACCEL programme has also been supported by two further great British pioneers, Jaguar Land Rover who have loaned all-electric zero emission Jaguar I-PACE cars as towing and support vehicles and Bremont, the luxury watchmaker, who were the official timing partner for the record attempt. The aircraft took off from the MoD’s Boscombe Down site, which is managed by QinetiQ and flew profiles according to the FAI guidelines for record attempts in the Powered Aeroplane C-1C Electric class. Test Pilot, Electroflight Steve Jones flew the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ aircraft for the 15km and the time to climb to 3000 metres record runs that have been submitted.\nGary Elliott, CEO of the Aerospace Technology Institute, said: “The ACCEL project demonstrates that strategic investment in UK technology and innovation can achieve extraordinary world-beating results, and sets us firmly on the path to decarbonising passenger flight in the future. This achievement of Rolls-Royce, Electroflight and YASA will resonate for many years to come and inspire the next generation of aerospace engineers. They deserve their place in the record books, and the ATI is proud to have played our part in that. Congratulations to the whole team.”\nOur involvement in the ACCEL project is just one of the ways in which we are looking to make aviation more sustainable. In June, we announced our pathway to net zero carbon emissions – a year on from joining the UN Race to Zero campaign – committing to ensure our new products will be compatible with net zero operation by 2030 and all our products will be compatible with net zero by 2050.\n", "中文原文": "2021年11月19日我们相信我们的全电动“创新精神”飞机是世界上最快的全电动飞机，创造了三项新的世界纪录。我们已经向国际航空联合会(FAI)提交了数据，该联合会是控制和认证世界航空和航天记录的世界航空运动联合会，在2021年11月16日15:45（格林威治时间），该飞机在3公里以上达到555.9公里/小时（345.4英里/小时）的最高速度，将现有记录打破了213.04公里/小时（132英里/小时）。根据我们的数据，在英国国防部博斯科姆下降实验飞机试验场的进一步飞行中，这架飞机在15公里内达到了532.1公里/小时（330英里/小时）--比之前的记录快292.8公里/小时（182英里/小时）--并以202秒的时间打破了爬升至3000米的最快时间60秒。我们希望FAI将在不久的将来认证和正式确认团队的成就。在破纪录的运行中，飞机的最高速度达到了623公里/小时（387.4英里/小时），我们相信这使得“创新精神”成为世界上最快的全电动汽车。劳斯莱斯首席执行官沃伦·伊斯特（Warren East）表示：“对阿塞尔团队和劳斯莱斯来说，争夺全电动世界速度记录是一项了不起的成就。我要感谢我们的合作伙伴，特别是Electroflight在实现这一开创性突破方面的合作。为该项目开发的先进电池和推进技术在先进空中机动市场有着令人兴奋的应用。继世界关注第二十六届缔约方会议采取行动的必要性之后，这是另一个里程碑，将有助于使“零号喷气机”成为现实，并支持我们实现社会在空中、陆地和海上运输脱碳所需的技术突破的雄心。“商务部长夸西·夸滕说：“劳斯莱斯创新飞机的革命精神进一步证明了英国在创新方面令人羡慕的资历。这一记录将展示电动飞行的潜力，并有助于解开可能使其成为日常生活一部分的技术。政府自豪地支持这样的项目，以利用必要的私人投资来开发更清洁、更绿色的飞机，让人们像现在这样飞行，但以减少排放的方式。““创新精神”是ACCEL或“加速飞行电气化”项目的一部分。该项目一半的资金由航空航天技术研究所(ATI)与商业、能源和工业战略部和英国创新组织合作提供。这架飞机是由400千瓦(500+马力）的电动动力系统和航空航天中有史以来最大功率的推进电池组推动的，打破了纪录。我们与航空储能专家Electric Flight和汽车动力系统供应商YASA合作。作为一项惊人的技术成就，该项目和世界纪录的运行为我们未来的电力和推进系统提供了重要的数据，用于全电动城市空中机动和混合动力通勤飞机。例如，“空中出租车”对电池的要求与“创新精神”的发展非常相似。Stjohn Youngman,Electric Flight董事总经理。“我们很高兴在这个里程碑式的项目中发挥了不可或缺的作用。它的成功是对Electroflight团队和我们供应商的奉献和创新的恰当致敬。与经验丰富的项目合作伙伴合作开发推进和电池系统，产生了世界级的工程能力，将引领航空旅行的脱碳。我们的下一步是调整这项开创性的技术，以便它可以在更广泛的航空航天行业应用，以提供一种更可持续的飞行方式。“劳斯莱斯拥有令人难以置信的飞行速度记录尝试和打破记录的历史，可以追溯到20世纪30年代初的施耐德奖杯。试飞员兼劳斯莱斯飞行运营总监菲尔·奥德尔（Phill O'Dell)本着“创新精神”实现的速度超过了213.04公里/小时（132英里/小时），比西门子eAirline Powered Extra 330 LE特技飞机在2017年创下的纪录还要快。在FAI记录尝试的历史上，从来没有在如此短的时间内有如此显著的速度增长，突出了航空航天电气化的快速推进。菲尔·奥德尔说：“以如此不可思议的速度飞行‘创新精神'，并相信我们已经打破了全电动飞行的世界纪录，这是一个重要的时刻。这是我职业生涯的高光时刻，对全队来说都是不可思议的成就。当我们期待实现航空的未来时，有机会站在劳斯莱斯故事的另一个开创性篇章的最前沿，这就是梦想的来源。“而这三个组织都是", "中文源标题": "“创新精神”赌注宣称是世界上最快的全电动汽车", "英文整编": "Rollo's all-electric aircraft \"Innovation Spirit\" has reached a top speed of 623 km/h in its recent flight, making it the fastest all-electric aircraft in the world.The \"Spirit of Innovation\" has set three new world records, and Rolls-Royce has submitted data to the International Aviation Federation (FAI).

By gathering experience with prototypes and studying electric propulsion architectures at the aircraft level, Safran is positioning itself as the supplier of a full range of motors for all-electric and hybrid propulsion systems, from light aircraft to narrowbodies.\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency （EASA）is expected to certify the company’s 100-kW （135-shp）EngineUs 100 electric propulsion unit in 2023. “Then we will launch the EngineUs 500,” says Herve Blanc, manager of the power division at Toulouse-based Safran Electrical & Power.\nThe designation of Safran’s motors indicates cruise power; their maximum power is greater. The EngineUs 100 and EngineUs 500 have maximum powers of 150 kW and 750 kW, respectively.\nFor light aircraft, Safran plans to market an electric counterpart to the existing Lycoming product range in piston engines. “From the beginning, the EngineUs 100—the motor itself and its distribution and protection systems—was created as a Lycoming replacement,” Blanc says.\nThe company also envisions a family of more powerful motors that would be the equivalent of Pratt & Whitney’s PT6A turboprop series. For example, the appropriate size for a 19-seat regional aircraft is the EngineUs 500, he says.\nU.S.-based Bye Aerospace received its first EngineUs 100s early this year. The motor will power the two-seat eFlyer 2 electric trainer, which is planned to fly this year; FAA Part 23 certification is expected in 2023. Bye’s other two projects are the four-seat eFlyer 4 and the 8-12-seat eFlyer 800. “We are jointly working on their architecture,” Blanc says. “We are converging.”\nSafran, meanwhile, has accumulated flight hours with two EngineUs 45s on French startup VoltAero’s Cassio 1 testbed. The motors are part of a hybrid-electric propulsion system on the modified Cessna 337H Skymaster. “The Cassio 1 has flown in rainy and cold conditions,” he says.\nThe motors have now been removed from the aircraft and disassembled for analysis. Although no issue was encountered, the examination will provide useful feedback. Engineers can see whether parts such as bearings experience wear as predicted after 100-200 hr. of operation, Blanc adds.\nA key part of the work with VoltAero has been on control law settings. An electric motor has a much faster response than a conventional aircraft engine. That responsiveness has to be adjusted so that a pilot is not too surprised during operation, Blanc says.\nIn addition, Safran supplied motors for Bell’s electrically distributed anti-torque （EDAT）system. The EDAT testbed, which flew in 2019, was a modified Bell 429 with four fixed-pitch electric fans mounted in the vertical stabilizer, replacing the conventional tail rotor.\nAn unnamed Chinese electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing prototype uses Safran motors as well. In total, over the various platforms, Safran’s EngineUs motors have logged 1,000 flight hours, Blanc says.\nHaving both European and U.S. customers is proving useful, allowing Safran to work with both EASA and the FAA to define a certification template. “We contribute to aligning their approaches,” Blanc adds.\nEarly in April, Safran signed agreements with Toulouse-based Aura Aero, a light and regional aircraft manufacturer. Safran will supply the propulsion system for Aura’s Integral E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater is an evolution of the Integral R, an aerobatic-capable piston single.\nSafran was to deliver a 100-kW EngineUs electric motor this summer so that the Integral E could fly by year-end. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing the two pilots. As a result, Aura’s electric project will likely be delayed.\nSafran had also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to work jointly on the ERA 19-seater. The aircraft is targeted at regional air transport, and though it is ultimately intended to have a full-electric configuration, it will initially receive a hybrid system.\nAura and Safran will collaborate on defining both the propulsive and nonpropulsive electric system architectures. “We will work as an integrated team and study trade-offs until the end of the year,” Blanc says. “We will answer questions such as what is the right level of distribution for propulsion.”\nWith today’s batteries, at a specific energy of 200-300 Wh/kg, the ERA may incorporate a turbine engine as a range extender. This will run at a constant, optimal speed to feed the motors directly or charge batteries. “Typically, takeoff would be all-electric, and cruise would use the range extender before an all-electric landing,” Blanc says.\nAura is planning on a first flight of the ERA in 2024 and entry into service in 2027. Such an aggressive schedule is possible, according to Blanc. “Our motors, batteries and distribution systems will be ready,” he says.\nThe next generation of solid-state batteries, expected to be available between 2025 and 2030, will have a specific energy of 400-500 Wh/kg. They might enable a 19-seater to be an all-electric system or, at least, to make less use of the range extender, Blanc says. They may be suitable for upgrading the aircraft after 2027.\nSafran will integrate cells from specialist suppliers, which will be carefully chosen for aerospace use. “A battery is a complicated object,” Blanc says. “Offering a good specific energy is not enough. We want to know the power it can deliver depending on the number of cycles it has performed. A chemistry is credible when it has been tested for weeks with cycles representative of aviation.”\nIn the future, Safran and GE Aviation—its partner in the CFM International joint venture—may consider the introduction of electric motors in a hybrid turbofan. Coupled with sustainable aviation fuels, motors that boost a thermal engine might be an efficient formula to cut a narrowbody’s CO2 emissions.\n", "中文原文": "赛峰正在进行其在电力推进方面的总体计划，同时追求电动马达的认证，同时与初创公司airframers合作。通过收集原型机的经验和研究飞机级的电力推进结构，赛峰将自己定位为全电动和混合动力推进系统的全系列电机供应商，从轻型飞机到窄体。欧盟航空安全局(EASA)预计将于2023年认证该公司的100千瓦(135-shp)工程100电力推进装置。“然后我们将推出EngineUs 500，”总部位于图卢兹的赛峰电力公司电力部门经理埃尔夫·布兰克说。赛峰的电机的名称表示巡航功率；它们的最大功率更大。EngineUs 100和EngineUs 500的最大功率分别为150千瓦和750千瓦。对于轻型飞机，Safran计划在现有的Lycomming产品系列中销售一款电动活塞发动机。布兰克说：“从一开始，EngineUs 100--电机本身及其分配和保护系统--就是作为莱来姆的替代品而创建的。”该公司还设想了一系列更强大的发动机，将相当于普惠公司的PT6A涡轮螺旋桨系列。他说，例如，19座支线飞机的合适尺寸是EngineUs 500。总部位于美国的Bye Aerospace今年早些时候收到了第一台Engineus 100。该电机将为双座eFlyer 2电动教练机提供动力，计划今年飞行；美国联邦航空局第23部分认证预计在2023年。Bye的另外两个项目是四座的eFlyer4和8-12座的eFlyer800。“我们正在共同致力于他们的架构，”布兰克说。“我们正在趋同。”与此同时，赛峰在法国初创公司伏尔泰罗的卡西奥1号测试床上积累了两架Engineus 45的飞行小时。发动机是改装的塞斯纳337H Skymaster上的混合电力推进系统的一部分。“卡西奥1号在下雨和寒冷的条件下飞行，”他说。发动机现在已经从飞机上移除，并被拆开进行分析。虽然没有遇到任何问题，但审查将提供有用的反馈。布兰克补充说，工程师可以看到轴承等部件在运行100-200小时后是否经历了预测的磨损。与Voltero合作的一个关键部分是控制律设置。电动机的响应比传统的飞机发动机快得多。布兰克说，这种反应必须进行调整，以便飞行员在操作过程中不会太惊讶。此外，赛峰还为贝尔的电动分布式反扭矩(EDAT)系统提供电机。2019年飞行的EDAT测试床是一种改进的贝尔429，在垂直稳定器上安装了四个固定螺距的电风扇，取代了传统的尾桨。一款未透露姓名的中国电动垂直起降样机也使用了赛峰汽车。布兰克说，在各种平台上，赛峰的EngineUs motors总共记录了1000个飞行小时。事实证明，拥有欧洲和美国的客户是有用的，这使得赛峰能够与EASA和FAA合作来定义认证模板。“我们有助于调整他们的方法，”布兰克补充道。4月初，赛峰与总部位于图卢兹的轻型和支线飞机制造商Aura Aero签署了协议。赛峰将为Aura的整体E飞行验证机提供推进系统。电动双座是一个整体R的演变，一个特技能力活塞单。赛峰将在今年夏天交付一台100千瓦的EngineUs电动机，这样Integral E就可以在年底前飞行。不幸的是，Integral R原型机于4月12日坠毁，两名飞行员遇难。因此，Aura的电力项目可能会被推迟。赛峰还与Aura签署了一份谅解备忘录，合作开发19座的ERA。该飞机的目标是区域航空运输，虽然它最终打算有一个全电动配置，但它最初将接受一个混合系统。Aura和Safran将合作定义推进式和非推进式电力系统架构。“我们将作为一个综合团队工作，研究权衡，直到年底，”布兰克说。“我们将回答推进的正确分配水平等问题。”今天的电池，在特定能量为200-300瓦时/千克时，电子逆向拍卖可能会合并涡轮发动机作为增程器。这将运行在一个恒定的，最佳的速度，直接给电机或充电电池。布兰克说：“通常情况下，起飞将是全电动的，巡航将在全电动着陆前使用航程扩展器。”Aura计划在2024年进行ERA的首次飞行，并在2027年投入服务。根据布兰克的说法，这样一个积极的时间表是可能的。“我们的电机、电池和配电系统将准备就绪，”他说。下一代o", "中文源标题": "赛峰霍恩斯电力推进战略", "英文整编": "Safran is pushing ahead with its electric propulsion master plan and is also seeking motor certification while working with start-up aircraft manufacturers. By accumulating prototype experience and studying the electric propulsion architecture at the aircraft level, Safran has positioned itself as a full range of motor suppliers for all-electric and hybrid electric propulsion systems from light aircraft to narrow-body aircraft.Safran's 100kW (135hp) EngineUs 100 motor is expected to be certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2023. After that, Safran will launch EngineUs 500.The name of Safran motor indicates the power in cruising state. The maximum power of EngineUs 100 and EngineUs 500 is 150 kW and 750 kW respectively.For light aircraft, Safran plans to introduce an electric product corresponding to the existing Laikangming piston engine product line. From the outset, the engine us 100 motor itself and its distribution and protection systems were designed as an alternative to Lacumine.Safran also envisions a series of more powerful electric motors, equivalent to Pratt & Whitney's PT6A turboprop engine series. EngineUs 500 for 19-seat regional aircraft.Bye Aerospace, based in the United States, received the first batch of EngineUs 100 in early 2022. The motor will serve as the power of its two-seat eFlyer 2 electric trainer and is scheduled to make its first flight in 2022; FAA Part 23 certification is expected in 2023. Bye's other two projects are the 4-seat eFlyer 4 and the 8-12-seat eFlyer 800.At the same time, Safran Group has carried out flight tests using two EngineUs 45 motors on the Cassio 1 flight test bench of French start-up VoltAero, and has completed the tests in rainy and cold environment. The motor has now been removed from the plane and disassembly analysis has been carried out. Engineers can see whether the expected wear of bearings and other components will occur after 100-200 hours of operation. A key part of VoltAero's work is the control law setup. The response speed of electric motor is much faster than that of traditional aircraft engine, so this response ability must be adjusted to help pilots get used to operation. EngineUs 45 is part of the improved Cessna 337H \"Air Overlord\" hybrid electric propulsion system.In addition, Safran also provides motors for Bell's Distributed Electric Anti-Torque (EDAT) system. The EDAT test bed that first flew in 2019 is a modified Bell 429, which is equipped with four fixed-pitch electric fans on the vertical stabilizer, replacing the traditional tail rotor.Safran motors are also used in an unnamed Chinese electric VTOL prototype. Overall, Safran's EngineUs motors have accumulated 1,000 flight hours on various platforms.Having customers in both Europe and the United States has proved very useful, and Safran can work with EASA and FAA to develop certification templates.In early April, Safran Group signed an agreement with Toulouse's light regional aircraft manufacturer Aura Aero. Safran will provide propulsion systems for Aura's Integrated E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater aircraft is an evolution of the Integrated R, a single-engine piston aircraft capable of aerobatics.Safran will deliver a 100kW EngineUs motor in the summer of 2022 so that the Integrated E can fly before the end of the year. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing two pilots. As a result, Aura's electricity project could be delayed.Safran also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to jointly develop the 19-seat regional aircraft ERA. The target of this aircraft is regional air transportation. In the initial stage, it adopts hybrid electric propulsion system, and finally it will adopt all-electric propulsion. Aura and Safran will work together to define propulsion and non-propulsion power system architectures.With the specific energy of 200 ~ 300Wh/kg of existing batteries, ERA may use turbine engine as range extender. The turbine engine runs at a constant optimum speed to directly drive the motor or charge the battery. Usually take-off and landing will be all-electric, and range extender, that is, turbine engine, will be used in cruise phase.Aura is scheduled to make the first flight of ERA in 2024 and be put into use in 2027.The next generation of solid-state batteries is expected to be launched from 2025 to 2030, with a specific energy of 400 ~ 500Wh/kg. This could see 19-seater aircraft adopt an all-electric propulsion system, or at least reduce the use of range extenders, which could be suitable for aircraft upgraded after 2027. Safran will integrate batteries from professional battery suppliers and verify battery performance through several aviation cycles of testing.In the future, Safran and GE may consider introducing electric motors into hybrid turbofan engines. Together with sustainable aviation fuel, it may be an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of narrow-body aircraft."}, {"中文标题": "法德企业签订返还放射性废物的合同", "情报来源": "世界核新闻网站", "时间": "2021年8月20日", "整编内容": "法国欧安诺集团（Orano）表示，已与德国4家电力公司签署合同，将这些公司留在阿格后处理厂的所有放射性废物归还给他们。这些总价值超过10亿欧元（12亿美元）的合同生效取决于德、法两国政府的正式协议。1977年至1991年之间，德国4家电力公司签订了乏燃料后处理合同。根据合同，法国阿格后处理厂处理了5310吨德国电力公司的乏燃料。这些乏燃料的后处理工作已于2008年完成。根据双方的承诺，1996年至2011年期间，99%以上的法国处理德国乏燃料后产生的高放废物已运回德国。然而，长寿期的中放废物（ILW）仍有待归还。Orano表示，这些新合同将使其能够完全履行此前对德国电力公司乏燃料进行后处理时作出的所有承诺。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中核战略规划研究总院", "源网址": "https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Orano-signs-contracts-for-return-of-German-waste", "源标题": "Orano signs contracts for return of German waste", "原文": "World Nuclear News 20 August 2021\nFrance's Orano said it has signed contracts with German utilities EnBW, PreussenElektra, RWE and Vattenfall for the return of all the German nuclear waste remaining at its La Hague reprocessing plant.

Under the contracts, 5310 metric tonnes of fuel were processed at the La Hague plant.\nThe recycling of German used nuclear fuel at La Hague was completed in 2008. The inter-governmental agreement governing those operations included a provision that the equivalent in mass and radioactivity of the waste contained in the used fuel elements must be returned to Germany, with shipments of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to be completed by 2011 and the return of long-lived intermediate-level waste (ILW) no later than 2024.

Laura Kelly announced Thursday that Kansas has an agreement with Integra Technologies, based in Wichita, for a 10-year package of tax breaks and reimbursement of expenses. State officials said the new, $1.8 billion plant would cover 1 million square feet, have 2,000 employees and create 3,000 additional jobs among suppliers and other local businesses.\nThe announcement comes with the U.S. trying to reverse a loss of capacity for making the chips that are vital to smartphones, laptops and other modern-day conveniences, as well as automobiles and life-saving medical devices. Congress last year approved a measure that provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry.\nKelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that the state's incentives are crucial to attracting the federal funds and \"making Kansas an essential part of our country's national security efforts.\"\n\"This advanced manufacturing facility is part of a national push to restore our semiconductor industry so that U.S. workers and businesses can compete and win in the race for the 21st Century,\" Kelly said.\nIntegra CEO Brett Robinson would not say how much federal funding the company needs, only that there is \"no commercially viable way\" to do the project without it. He and state officials said other states were trying to attract the project, though they did not disclose the competitors.\n\"It's not just critical to the United States and to security, but it's critical to the supply chain,\" said Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican.\nPresident Joe Biden pushed Congress last year to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, because of a shortage of chips made worse by the global coronavirus pandemic and concerns about competing with international rivals, particularly China. There's been a decades-long shift to cheaper-to-operate Asian chip plants, and the industry is now dependent on Taiwan, which China has long claimed as its own.\n\"If we were ever to lose, for a sustainable amount of time, access to the southeast Asian supply chain, what we just went through would pale in comparison,\" Robinson said.\nIntegra, founded in 1983, has about 500 employees in Wichita and Silicon Valley and describes itself as the largest U.S. provider of the last two major assembly and testing steps in the chip manufacturing process. The new factory is expected to pay an average annual wage of $51,000, about 46% higher than the state's average of roughly $35,000.\nFor Integra to receive its incentives, it must invest at least $1.5 billion in the new factory in the next five years and consistently provide the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs for 10 consecutive years.\nThe incentives are part of a program Kansas created last year to ramp up its efforts to compete with other states for new, large factories. Under that program, the state was allowed to offer up to $1 billion in incentives to a single company each in 2022 and 2023.\nIn July 2022, Kelly and other state officials announced that Panasonic Corp. plans to build a mega-factory to produce electric vehicle batteries for Tesla and other carmakers. The state lured the Japanese electronics giant's project to the edge of the Kansas City area with incentives worth $829 million over 10 years, the most the state has ever offered.\nThe law allowing the incentives required top leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature to sign off any deal between a company and the state Department of Commerce, which is led by Lt. Gov. David Toland, a Democrat like Kelly. The legislative leaders gave their approval just minutes ahead of the announcement, after meeting in private with Kelly for half an hour to review the agreement, with no opportunity for public review or input.\nThe law also requires Kansas to drop its corporate income tax rates by half a percentage point for each mega-deal. If the Integra project goes forward, the top rate would decline to 6% from 7%, saving all corporations roughly $100 million a year.\nWhile both mega-projects have had bipartisan support, some lawmakers are critical of promising such big taxpayer-funded incentives to a single firm.\n\"We have not written the checks for this first project and they're starting the second one without even knowing that it works,\" state Senate tax committee Chair Caryn Tyson, a conservative Republican from eastern Kansas, said before Thursday's announcement.\n", "中文原文": "堪萨斯州计划向其最大城市的一家半导体公司提供3.04亿美元的纳税人资助激励措施，以建设一个巨大的新工厂，但如果没有美国政府承诺的重建国家芯片制造能力的资金，该项目将无法推进。州长劳拉·凯利（Laura Kelly）周四宣布，堪萨斯州与总部位于威奇托的Integra Technologies达成了一项为期10年的税收减免和费用报销一揽子协议。州官员表示，这座耗资18亿美元的新工厂将占地100万平方英尺，有2000名员工，并为供应商和其他当地企业创造3000个额外就业机会。这一声明发布之际，美国正试图扭转制造芯片的能力损失，这些芯片对智能手机、笔记本电脑和其他现代便利设施以及汽车和救生医疗设备至关重要。国会去年批准了一项措施，为半导体行业提供超过520亿美元的赠款和其他激励措施。凯利在州议会新闻发布会上告诉记者，该州的激励措施对吸引联邦资金和“使堪萨斯州成为我国国家安全努力的重要组成部分”至关重要。凯利说：“这个先进的制造设施是国家努力恢复我们的半导体行业的一部分，这样美国工人和企业就可以在21世纪的竞争中竞争并获胜。”Integra首席执行官布雷特·罗宾逊（Brett Robinson）不愿透露该公司需要多少联邦资金，只表示没有联邦资金，就没有“商业上可行的方法”来完成该项目。他和州官员表示，其他州正在试图吸引该项目，但他们没有透露竞争对手。威奇托地区共和党人、堪萨斯州参议院议长泰·马斯特森（Ty Masterson）表示：“这不仅对美国和安全至关重要，对供应链也至关重要。”乔·拜登（Joe Biden）总统去年推动国会提振美国半导体行业，因为全球新冠肺炎疫情加剧了芯片短缺，并担心与国际竞争对手，特别是中国竞争。几十年来，亚洲芯片厂已经转向运营成本更低的工厂，该行业现在依赖台湾，中国长期以来一直声称台湾是自己的。罗宾逊说：“如果我们在可持续的时间内失去进入东南亚供应链的机会，与之相比，我们刚刚经历的一切将相形见绌。”Integra成立于1983年，在威奇托和硅谷拥有约500名员工，自称是芯片制造过程中最后两个主要组装和测试步骤的美国最大供应商。新工厂预计将支付平均年薪5.1万美元，比该州约3.5万美元的平均工资高出约46%。Integra要想获得激励措施，必须在未来五年内向新工厂投资至少15亿美元，并连续10年提供相当于1600个全职工作岗位的服务。这些激励措施是堪萨斯州去年创建的一项计划的一部分，该计划旨在加大与其他州竞争新的大型工厂的力度。根据该计划，该州被允许在2022年和2023年各向一家公司提供高达10亿美元的激励措施。2022年7月，凯利和其他州官员宣布，松下公司计划建造一家巨型工厂，为特斯拉和其他汽车制造商生产电动汽车电池。该州在10年内以价值8.29亿美元的激励措施将这家日本电子巨头的项目吸引到堪萨斯城地区的边缘，这是该州有史以来提供的最多激励措施。允许激励措施的法律要求共和党控制的立法机构的最高领导人签署公司和州商务部之间的任何协议，州商务部由副州长大卫·托兰（David Toland）领导，他是像凯利一样的民主党人。立法领导人在宣布前几分钟批准了协议，此前他们与凯利私下会面了半个小时，审查了协议，没有公开审查或投入的机会。该法律还要求堪萨斯州将每笔大型交易的公司所得税税率降低0.5个百分点。如果Integra项目继续下去，最高利率将从7%下降到6%，每年为所有公司节省大约1亿美元。虽然这两个大型项目都得到了两党的支持，但一些立法者对承诺向一家公司提供如此大的纳税人资助激励措施持批评态度。堪萨斯州东部的保守派共和党人、州参议院税收委员会主席卡琳·泰森（Caryn Tyson）在周四宣布之前表示：“我们还没有为第一个项目开出支票，他们甚至不知道它是否有效就开始了第二个项目。”", "中文源标题": "堪萨斯州承诺向芯片厂投资3.04亿美元以吸引联邦资金", "英文整编": "Recently, Kansas promised to invest 3. 5% in chip factories. 0.4 billion dollars to attract federal funds to build a new factory.

However, a major challenge is making a scalable, integrated platform to deploy and commercialize.\nOne of the drawbacks of quantum photonics is that small interfaces and quantum effects could distort data signals and make them unusable. Because they use light instead of electrons, quantum applications also require new technologies for filtering, amplifying, and conditioning optical signals.\nResearchers at the University of Twente recently developed a new technique to confine sound and light waves in a multilayer silicon nitride waveguide. Their solution can alter optical signals with sound in large-scale integrated circuits. The device is also compatible with current production methods. \nStimulated Brillouin Scattering\nProcessing, amplifying, and filtering optical signals are at the heart of quantum photonics. One method to do this effectively is a coherent optomechanical interaction technique called stimulated Brillouin scattering. Brillouin scattering occurs when optical waves interact with acoustic lattice vibrations or phonons.\nWhen a photon interacts with a substance, energy transfers to acoustic phonons. The incident photon scatters to slightly lower energy and propagates in the opposite direction. This scattering of photons by acoustic phonons is called Brillouin scattering.\nMaximum scattering occurs when the reflected light overlaps in phase with sound waves. Therefore, the scattering is highly frequency selective, and the reflected wave reduces in frequency by about 1–15 GHz due to the Doppler shift. This effect plays an important role in optical amplifiers and filters.\nThis scattering is achieved by using two finely-tuned lasers to generate a soundwave and trap it in a waveguide. Light passing through the waveguide interacts with the soundwave and undergoes scattering and Doppler shift, effectively filtering the signal.\nFor such applications, silicon nitride waveguides are preferred due to their nonlinear refractive index and CMOS compatibility.\nSilicon Nitride Waveguides\nSilicon nitride waveguides are a non-linear high refractive index and low-loss semiconductor, which is advantageous for various non-linear optical applications. The waveguides consist of a bottom reflector stacked on a silicon nitride platform and clad with an oxide buffer layer underneath. These layers are fabricated with an LCVD (laser chemical vapor deposition) device and can be patterned to a specific shape, making it CMOS-compatible.\nThe high refractive index of the dielectric material allows high optical confinement and control over dispersion with the waveguide structure. Despite better mode confinement, silicon nitride is less expensive than its counterparts. Therefore, this material has emerged as a workhorse for nonlinear optics in recent years.\nPrevious studies have suggested that implementing stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon nitride can unlock promising new technologies like on-chip amplifiers and lasers. However, the demonstration is usually plagued by acoustic leakage from the silicon nitride core and the oxide cladding. This effect prevents strong Brillouin interactions and makes these waveguides ineffective for trapping sound waves.\nTrapping Sound and Light with Multilayer Silicon Nitride Waveguides\nResearchers at the University of Twente used low-loss multilayer silicon nitride nano-photonic circuits consisting of 50 cm-long spiral waveguides to confine optical and sound waves.

In the research, the researchers used a low-loss multilayer silicon nitride nano-photonic circuit chip composed of a 50 cm long spiral waveguide to limit light waves and sound waves. This arrangement prevented sound leakage in a single silicon nitride chip, thus accurately controlling the separation between silicon nitride layers, changing the sound wave guide and suppressing the scattering of sound waves in the waveguide. Because multilayer silicon nitride waveguides can realize circuit-level stimulated Brillouin scattering, researchers have also created a new concept for verification of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, using notch filters with only 0. The increase of 4 decibels is beneficial, and the high inhibition of 66 decibels is achieved.

A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build up to 10 SMRs by 2035.\nThe MoU was signed at the Nuclear Industry Association's Nuclear2021 conference in London last week. It follows the creation of Rolls-Royce SMR Ltd, which has been established to bring forward and deliver the next generation of low-cost, low-carbon nuclear power technology.\nRolls-Royce said the project \"directly supports the UK's civil nuclear renaissance and the development of SMRs in the UK, with Sheffield Forgemasters able to supply the complex, nuclear-grade demonstrator forgings as part of the regulatory process.\"\n\"Sheffield Forgemasters are world leaders in complex, safety-critical forgings and castings and we are incredibly fortunate to have their experience to support and enable our SMR programme,\" said Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson. \"This agreement is the start of an enduring partnership and reflects our commitment to the UK supply chain as we look to re-build and re-energise the vital UK nuclear supply chain.\"\nSheffield Forgemasters CEO David Bond added: \"SMRs have the potential to become the standard for civil nuclear power generation and, as an emerging market, fit extremely well with our long track record of supplying nuclear power components into the UK submarine programme.\n\"With a new investment fund of GBP400 million (USD530 million) to replace our defence critical assets, including the provision of a new 13,000 tonne forging line and 19 state-of-the-art machining centres, we will create much higher levels of manufacturing capability and efficiency, to the benefit of defence nuclear work, but with obvious cross-benefits for civil nuclear activity, including SMRs.\n\"Rolls-Royce is advancing plans for factory assembled SMRs in the UK and Sheffield Forgemasters is well positioned to be a UK supply chain partner in the delivery of complex, finished and semi-finished nuclear-grade components into the SMR build programme.\"\nAccording to Rolls-Royce, when fully operational the Rolls-Royce SMR programme will create 40,000 UK jobs primarily across the North and Midlands, where the majority of UK nuclear expertise is located, with the potential for GBP52 billion in economic benefits from export.\nLast month, Rolls-Royce SMR issued a Notice of Intention to submit its 470 MWe SMR design for entry to the UK's Generic Design Assessment (GDA) regulatory process. The review of the SMR design - based on a small pressurised water reactor - will formally begin once the government has assessed the company's capability and capacity to successfully enter the GDA process.\nA Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium - which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI - aims to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.\nTo minimise the construction phase of the programme, the UK SMR is fully modularised to enable the plant to be transported by road, rail or sea. Targeting a 500-day modular build, the consortium says this concept minimises the onsite time and effort required to construct and build the plant. About 80% of the plant's components will be sourced from the UK. The target cost for each station is GBP1.8 billion by the time five have been built, with further savings possible.

It has received a three-year funding package totalling ?1.5M from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\nPrincipal InvestigatorDr Alborz Shokrani, a Senior Lecturer in Bath’sDepartment of Mechanical Engineeringand a member of theAdvanced Design and Manufacturing Centre, says that new cutting-specific sensing technology is needed to achieve greater accuracy and deal with new manufacturing challenges, particularly in the aerospace and automotive industries.\nThe researchers say that currently, as much as 4% of aerospace manufacturing costs are spent on replacing cutting tools early, despite only 50-80% of a cutting tool’s life being effectively used. With a global market size of over $34bn for cutting tools, this wastage represents a huge opportunity for savings and improving the sustainability of machining.\nDr Shokrani says: “It’s has become received wisdom in industry that to machine a part like a landing gear for an aeroplane, you need a large, incredibly stiff machine to achieve the necessary precision, but the consequence of this is that machining costs grow exponentially in line with greater precision. This has resulted in the need for expensive and non-value adding verification and error compensation methods – which do not consider tool geometry, cutting forces and time-variable errors.\n“The idea of sensors in cutting tools is not new but these sensor embedded tools lack the sophisticated data analysis amd decision-making capability that they truly require. They rely on technologies which are not tailored for cutting and are not integrated into the machining control system.”\nProject co-investigatorDr Ali Mohammadi, from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, adds: “Existing high precision sensors are either too large or too costly to be useful outside of laboratory applications, and off-the-shelf sensors and data transmission devices are not necessarily suitable for monitoring or controlling machining processes. We aim to create a series of sensors specifically for machining that will help manufacturers improve quality without facing major cost implications.”\nDr Shokrani explains that additive manufacturing (3D printing) also created new challenges for cutting tools: “3D printing has helped us create more optimised parts with complex geometries, but these can require bespoke finishing with long slender tools. In these cases, cutting forces can bend the tool and the workpiece, resulting in undesired vibrations and geometrical inaccuracies. In turn, this damages surface integrity and shortens the life of tools. Better sensors and intelligent control systems could bring major benefits to all kinds of precision cutting applications.”\nResearchers from Bath will work alongside colleagues from the Universities of Nottingham and Sheffield during the project.

The AD series reactors, designed by OKBM, are water-cooled uranium-graphite thermal neutron reactors.\nA total of five industrial uranium-graphite reactors operated at SCC: I-1, EI-2, ADE-3, ADE-4, ADE-5. They were intended for the production of plutonium with ADE-4, ADE-5 also producing production of thermal and electrical energy. The decommissioning of EI-2 was formally accepted as completed by a government commission in 2015 - the first ever decommissioning of a commercial uranium-graphite reactor. To guarantee safe storage of the reactor for tens of thousands of years, SCC in 2010 established UDC UGR, which, in co-operation with leading research centres of the Russian Academy of Sciences, developed a unique decommissioning technology whereby all reactor cavities were filled with a mix of natural clays.\nEI-2 began operating in February 1958 at the Tomsk-7 closed city (now Seversk). It was SCC's second industrial uranium-graphite reactor. The first (I-1) was launched in 1955 and together they formed the first dual-purpose NPP producing both weapons-grade plutonium and 100MWe of electricity. In the 1960s SCC put three more dual-purpose reactors into operation - ADE-3 (1961), ADE-4 (1964) and ADE-5 (1965) boosting power production to 600 MWe. These were designed by the NN Dollezhal Research & Development Institute of Power Engineering (Nikiet).\nUnder a Russian-US agreement to end production of military-grade plutonium, I-1 was closed in 1990, EI-2 in 1991 and ADE-3 in 1992. ADE 4 and ADE 5 continued operating until 2008 as they also provided power to the site. After the decommissioning of EI-2 in 2015, it was expected that the withdrawal of the remaining four shutdown reactors at SCC would take about five years but this was extended by a year and in 2021, Rosatom signed a state contract with UDC UGR, which was tasked with dismantling and fragmentation of radiation-contaminated equipment and pipelines, as well as concreting of the ADE-5 sub-reactor space. The work was expected to take two years.\nIn the course of the work, some 1,500 tons of equipment and pipelines of the first and second circuits of the ADE-4 and ADE-5 reactors were dismantled and fragmented, which, according to the results of radiation measurements, were classified as radioactive waste. They were fragmented, packaged in containers and placed on a specially prepared temporary storage site. Part of the dismantled pipelines was deactivated and returned to the national economy as scrap metal.\nThe need to carry out work on the dismantling and movement of large-tonnage equipment under cramped conditions when exposed to radiation exposure significantly complicated the work.” explained Egor Paderin, head of the decommissioning service of nuclear installations.\nA lot of preparatory work was carried out to concrete the sub-reactor space of the ADE-5 reactor mine: access roads for concrete trucks and concrete pump installation sites were organised, walkways and open-air openings were made in the walls and inter-story floors. During preparation of the premises for concreting, 107 tons of equipment and metal structures, about eight tons of plastic and more than two tons of electric cable were dismantled. All generated waste was fragmented, packaged in containers and placed on the special site. When concreting the reactor mine, heavy concrete with a waterproofing additive was used. In total, more than 2,500 cubic metres of concrete was required for the bottom of the reactor mine\nAll work under the state contract was completed in full and on time for a total cost of RUB412m ($6m). The work was carried as part of the project “Decommissioning of industrial uranium-graphite reactors ADE-4 and ADE-5 using the ‘on-site burial’ option developed by the All-Russia Science Research and Design Institute of Power Engineering Technology (VNIPIET).\nAs well as the three uranium graphite reactors built at SCC, three others were constructed at the Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) in Zheleznogorsk (Krasnoyarsk). The first AD reactor was launched in 1958 at MCC, solely for plutonium production. The second, ADE-1, launched in 1961, was intended also to produce electricity (hence the “E” for energy in its name) but never did so as the combined heat and power plant (CHPP) had not been completed. ADE-2 began operation in December 1963 after the CHPP was in place. All three reactors were built underground and used cooling water from the Yenisei River.\nIt was a huge undertaking. Some 27,000 prisoners worked on the construction of underground reactors. The volume of rock removed was several million cubic metres. More than 1 million cubic metres of concrete were laid, and tens of thousands of tons of metal structures, pipelines, cables were put in place. In the underground rooms, giant fans were installed with a capacity of about 1m cubic metres of air per hour. In 1992, the AD and ADE-1 reactors at MCC were shut down. MCC is investigating possible methods for decommissioning AD and ADE-1, Following public hearings in 2013 MCC said it favoured burying them on site as the mountain under which they were built forms a natural safety barrier.\nADE-2 was the last of Russia’s dual purpose plutonium production reactors to be closed. It was shut down in 2010, after producing weapons-grade plutonium for nearly 52 years, in line with a 1997 Plutonium Production Reactor Agreement with the US. It also provided heat and electricity to Zheleznogorsk and nearby areas, which was its main function after1993. It continued to produce weapons-grade plutonium as a by-product, but under the terms of the US agreement, this could not be used for weapons purposes and was stockpiled.\nADE-2 in 2021 became a nuclear industry museum, joining the world's first nuclear icebreaker Lenin and the Obninsk NPP, the world's first civil nuclear power plant.\n", "中文原文": "2023年1月13日打印电子邮件俄罗斯铀-石墨核反应堆退役实验示范中心（UDC UGR,国家核工业公司Rosatom的一部分）已经完成了位于塞夫斯克西伯利亚化学联合企业(SCC)的工业反应堆ADE-4和ADE-5的技术设备和管道的拆除和碎片化工作。AD系列反应堆是由OKBM设计的水冷铀-石墨热中子反应堆。共有五个工业铀-石墨反应堆在SCC运行:I-1、EI-2、ADE-3、ADE-4、ADE-5。它们的目的是生产钚，ADE-4、ADE-5还生产热能和电能。EI-2的退役于2015年被一个政府委员会正式接受为完成--这是商业铀石墨反应堆的首次退役。为了保证反应堆安全储存数万年，SCC于2010年成立了UDC UGR，该公司与俄罗斯科学院的主要研究中心合作，开发了一种独特的退役技术，所有反应堆腔体都用天然粘土混合填充。EI-2于1958年2月在Tomsk-7封闭城市（现在的塞夫斯克）开始运行。这是SCC的第二个工业铀-石墨反应堆。第一个(I-1)于1955年发射，它们一起组成了第一个两用核电厂，生产武器级钚和100MWe的电力。在20世纪60年代，SCC又投入了三个两用反应堆--ADE-3(1961)、ADE-4(1964)和ADE-5(1965)将功率生产提高到600兆瓦。这些是由NN Dollezhal动力工程研究与发展研究所（Nikiet）设计的。根据俄美终止军用级钚生产的协议，I-1于1990年关闭，EI-2于1991年关闭，ADE-3于1992年关闭。ADE4和ADE5一直运行到2008年，因为它们也为现场提供电力。2015年EI-2退役后，预计SCC剩余四个关闭反应堆的退出将需要大约五年时间，但这一时间延长了一年，2021年，Rosatom与UDC UGR签署了一份国家合同，其任务是拆除和分割受辐射污染的设备和管道，以及为ADE-5子反应堆空间浇筑混凝土。这项工作预计需要两年时间。在工作过程中，ADE-4和ADE-5反应堆第一和第二回路的大约1500吨设备和管道被拆除和破碎，根据辐射测量结果，这些设备和管道被归类为放射性废物。它们被分割成碎片，装在集装箱里，放在一个特别准备的临时储存场地上。部分被拆除的管道被停用，并作为废金属返回国民经济。在受到辐射照射的情况下，需要在狭窄的条件下进行大吨位设备的拆除和移动工作，这使工作变得非常复杂。“核设施退役服务负责人埃戈尔·帕德林解释说。为将ADE-5反应堆矿的子反应堆空间混凝土化进行了大量准备工作：为混凝土卡车和混凝土泵安装场地组织了通道，在墙壁和层间楼层中设置了走道和露天开口。在准备房地浇筑混凝土期间，拆除了107吨设备和金属结构、约8吨塑料和两吨多电缆。所有产生的废物都被碎片化，用容器包装，放在特殊的场地上。在给反应堆矿井浇筑混凝土时，使用了带有防水添加剂的重混凝土。反应堆地雷底部总共需要2500多立方米混凝土国家合同下的所有工作都按时全面完成，总费用为4.12亿卢比（600万美元）。这项工作是作为“使用全俄电力工程技术科学研究设计院(VNIPIET)开发的‘现场掩埋’选项退役工业铀石墨反应堆ADE-4和ADE-5”项目的一部分进行的。除了在SCC建造的三个铀石墨反应堆外，在热列兹诺戈尔斯克（克拉斯诺亚尔斯克）的采矿和化学联合企业(MCC)还建造了另外三个反应堆。第一个AD反应堆于1958年在中冶公司发射，专门用于钚生产。第二个，ADE-1于1961年发射，也是为了发电（因此其名称中的“E”代表能源），但从未这样做，因为联合热电厂(CHPP)尚未完成。ADE-2在CHPP到位后于1963年12月开始运作。这三个反应堆都建在地下，使用叶尼塞河的冷却水。这是一项巨大的事业。大约27000名囚犯从事地下反应堆的建设。移除的岩石体积达数百万立方米。超过1米", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯拆除两座铀石墨反应堆", "英文整编": "Russia's National Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom) recently completed the dismantling of two military plutonium production reactors ADE-4 and ADE-5.
