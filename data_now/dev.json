At a Chinese shipyard, the keel-laying ceremony was held for a barge that will later be fitted with two RITM-200S reactors.\nThe keel laying ceremony (Image: Atomenergomash)\nThe barge will measure 140 metres long and 30 metres wide, said Rosatom, and will feature structures for containment and radioactive waste storage as well as fuel tanks for diesel, according to previous TASS reports. On delivery to Atomenergomash by the end of next year the barge will weigh 9549 tons and when fitted out with two RITM-200S pressurised water reactors and all the equipment it needs to function as a power plant it will weigh some 19,088 tons. The reactor components are already being manufactured.\nAtomflot will then take control as the owner and operator of the floating nuclear power plant when it is complete. It will be transferred to Cape Nagloynyn in the Russian Arctic where it will supply 105 MWe to a new port and the forthcoming Baimskaya copper and gold mine. This is scheduled to happen by 2027.\nIn total, the Baimskaya development requires around 300 MWe, therefore three such floating power plants are needed, while a fourth will be installed as backup for outages during refuelling and maintenance.\nAndrey Nikipelov, head of Atomenergomash said: \"This project begins the history of a whole family of floating nuclear power plants, different in capacity and purpose - in the Arctic and tropical versions, which Atomenergomash is ready to offer to the market and which undoubtedly have a very serious potential for the implementation of large industrial projects and exports.\"\nRussia already has one floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, which is stationed at Pevek where it supplies heat and power to the town. This is based on two KLT-40S reactors generating 35 MWe each, which are similar to those used in a previous generation of nuclear powered icebreakers. So-called 'modernised floating nuclear power plants' like the ones for Cape Nagloynyn feature reactors from the new RITM series, as used in the latest generation of icebreakers. RITM units can also be used on land and a single-reactor plant is planned for Ust-Kuyga in Russia's far east.\nNo specific name was given to the new barge, and the overall project comprising four floating power plants and eight reactors is known simply as Cape Nagloynyn. Rosatom announced the ceremony without specifying exactly which shipyard was doing the work, but in November last year it was reported by TASS to be Wison Heavy Industries, a specialist in large offshore platforms with a manufacturing base in Nantong.\n", "中文原文": "2022年8月31日Nagloynyn角项目的四个浮动核电站中的第一个已经开始建设，该项目将为俄罗斯北极的一个巨大矿业开发提供动力。在一家中国造船厂，为一艘驳船举行了龙骨铺设仪式，这艘驳船稍后将安装两个RITM-200S反应堆。龙骨铺设仪式（图片：Atomenergomash）据塔斯社此前报道，罗萨托姆说，这艘驳船长140米，宽30米，将有安全壳和放射性废物储存结构以及柴油燃料箱。明年年底交付给Atomenergomash后，这艘驳船将重9549吨，当配备两个RITM-200S压水反应堆和作为发电厂所需的所有设备时，它将重约19088吨。反应堆组件已经在制造中。Atomflot随后将作为浮动核电站的所有者和运营商获得控制权。它将被转移到俄罗斯北极的Nagloynyn角，在那里它将向一个新港口和即将到来的Baimskaya铜金矿供应105兆瓦。这将于2027年实现。Baimskaya的开发总共需要大约300兆瓦，因此需要三个这样的浮动发电厂，同时将安装第四个，作为加油和维护期间停电的后备。Atomenergomash负责人安德烈·尼基佩洛夫（Andrey Nikipelov）表示：“该项目开启了一整套浮动核电站的历史，它们的容量和用途不同--在北极和热带版本中，Atomenergomash准备向市场提供这些核电站，无疑对实施大型工业项目和出口具有非常大的潜力。”俄罗斯已经有一个浮动核电站，阿卡德米克·罗蒙诺索夫，驻扎在佩韦克，为该镇提供热量和电力。这是基于两个每个产生35兆瓦的KLT-40S反应堆，与上一代核动力破冰船使用的反应堆相似。所谓的“现代化浮动核电站”，如Nagloynyn角的核电站，采用了新RITM系列的反应堆，用于最新一代破冰船。RITM机组也可以在陆地上使用，并计划在俄罗斯远东的乌斯特-库伊加建立一个单反应堆工厂。没有给出新驳船的具体名称，包括四个浮动发电厂和八个反应堆的整个项目被简单地称为Nagloynyn角。Rosatom宣布了仪式，但没有具体说明哪家造船厂在做这项工作，但去年11月，据塔斯社报道，该造船厂是威森重工，一家大型海上平台专家，在南通设有制造基地。", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯下一座浮动核电站开工建设", "英文整编": "The first floating nuclear power plant of Cape Nagloynyn project in Russia has started construction.

They include increasing the use of multi-year contracts, simplifying program requirements, securing supply chains to eliminate delays in production, supporting industry recruitment efforts, and securing access to private funding networks for France’s defense industry.\nMeanwhile, Norway last month announced a deal worth 2.6 billion Krone (U.S. $257 million) to procure artillery shells from Nammo, in a deal hailed by the nation’s defense minister as the largest ever,according to reports.\nThe United States has also focused on replenishing its munitions stockpiles, though some defense firms have signaled they won’t expand capacity without firm government commitments in spite of growing defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe U.S. Congress has backed multiyear purchases of certain munitions, and U.S. Army officials say they are undergoing the fastest artillery ramp up since the Korean War.\nWhile some munition production boosts have begun, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks is leading an effort to unclog industrial bottlenecks.\n", "中文原文": "比维维埃内马奇2月13日08:46PM布鲁塞尔--着眼于乌克兰保护自己免受俄罗斯持续进攻的需求，北约计划实施新的库存指导方针，同时与成员国的国防工业合作，增加自己的武库，同时继续填充基辅的武库。北约秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格周一在布鲁塞尔总部对记者发表讲话时，直言不讳地评估了弹药库存和交付时间。“目前的弹药消耗率更高，大于目前的生产率。这是事实，“斯托尔滕贝格说。例如，军方领取大口径弹药的等待时间从12个月增加到28个月。“今天下的订单只能在两年半后交付，”他补充说。他说，在过去的几个月里，北约对其库存进行了“非同寻常的、非周期的”调查，并计划在2月14日至15日的国防部长会议上决定新的能力目标指导方针。他指出，近一年前，当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，北约盟国发现，支持保卫国家对火炮需求的唯一方法是“挖掘我们现有的库存”。“但当然，从长远来看，我们不能继续这样做。”斯托尔滕贝格说，北约成员国正在与各自的国防工业合作，为弹药和其他防御能力启动新的多年采购协议。法国国防部上周宣布了五项旨在支持生产周期的新行动。这些措施包括增加多年期合同的使用，简化项目要求，确保供应链的安全以消除生产延误，支持行业招聘工作，以及确保法国国防工业进入私人融资网络。与此同时，据报道，挪威上个月宣布了一项价值26亿克朗（2.57亿美元）的协议，从Nammo购买炮弹，这是该国国防部长称赞的有史以来最大的协议。美国还专注于补充其弹药储备，尽管一些国防公司表示，尽管俄罗斯入侵乌克兰推动了国防支出和武器需求的增长，但如果没有政府的坚定承诺，他们不会扩大产能。美国国会支持多年购买某些弹药，美国陆军官员表示，他们正在经历自朝鲜战争以来最快的火炮增兵。虽然一些弹药生产已经开始增加，但美国国防部副部长凯瑟琳·希克斯（Kathleen Hicks）正在领导一项疏通工业瓶颈的努力。", "中文源标题": "关注乌克兰，北约准备新的弹药指导方针以提高产量", "英文整编": "Considering Ukraine's need to protect itself from the continued Russian offensive, NATO plans to implement new ammunition stockpile guidelines, while cooperating with member countries' defense industries to increase its own stockpiles while continuing to support Ukraine.NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg said that the current ammunition consumption rate is higher than the production rate.

Photo from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine via Facebook.\nFor months now, Ukraine has faced a barrage of Russian missile and drone attacks, straining its Soviet-era air defenses. But as the U.S. and its allies work to provide Ukraine with upgraded technology to defend against those strikes, an open-source intelligence analysis has found the Russian missiles have plenty of U.S. technology of their own.\nIn a Jan. 10 briefing, analysts from the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies, detailed how many of Russia’s missiles have American and other Western components, despite export controls in place.\n“All of these pieces of equipment were absolutely filled with Western components,” James Byrne, the Director of the Open Source Intelligence and Analysis Research Group at RUSI, said. “For us, it’s very interesting, very surprising. Nearly everything that we found in those systems was manufactured, designed by American companies.”\nBryne said RUSI was able to conduct its extensive assessments in part because Ukraine has offered up weapons it has shot down, captured, or collected the wreckage of, for inspection by analysts. \n“As the course of the war progressed, a lot of the components that we saw in these platforms and that we have since seen in these platforms are relatively new,” Byrne said. “The Russians have been doing it for a really long time, and they’re still doing it now.” \nByrne said the two largest suppliers of tech it found in Russian weapons were the U.S.-based Analog Devices and Texas Instruments—much of that technology has non-military applications, making a crackdown on their export harder. And according to the British think tank, Russia has various schemes to smuggle technology into the country, including front companies in third countries. \nThe U.S. has put in place expansive export controls to prevent American technology and goods from heading to Russia since Moscow’s renewed invasion begin in February 2022. That’s on top of other steps the U.S. took after the original Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, including the strengthening of export controls on weapons technology. \nHowever, according to RUSI, some of the weapons used by Russia in Ukraine have been made in the past year. \n“It’s always been the case that there was a huge interest in acquiring American technology,” Byrne said. “Despite Russian efforts to sort of build this sort of domestic homegrown semiconductor industry, despite the propaganda, despite the discussion about import substitution, they haven’t succeeded in doing that. I personally don’t think they will ever really be able to succeed in doing that. And so it leaves them really critically dependent on foreign technology.” \nThe Department of Commerce did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Air & Space Forces Magazine on the effectiveness of U.S. export controls. \nAs Russia has continued to pummel Ukrainian infrastructure this winter, the U.S. and its allies have sought to provide Ukraine with an integrated, modern air and missile defense network. Most recently, both the U.S. and Germany have pledged to give the Ukrainians one of its more advanced systems: the PATRIOT air defense system.\nOn Jan. 10, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder announced that Ukrainian soldiers will begin training to operate the PATRIOT at Fort Sill, the same place American troops are trained on the system, as soon as next week.\nDoing so will require Ukraine to pull some troops off the front lines; Training on a U.S. PATRIOT battery takes several months, though it could be expedited by skipping some steps deemed nonessential. \n“The longer those troops are off the line, they’re not actually engaged in combat, and so [we’re] trying to work with the Ukrainians to see what we can do to accelerate the training timeline,” Ryder said. “In terms of what that training will look like, it will consist of training in the classrooms, it will consist of training on the PATRIOT systems, and then of course, in a simulation lab as well before they actually deploy the capability on the battlefield.” \nRyder said Ukraine plans to send soldiers already trained in air defense to Fort Sill, where the Ukrainian troops will be instructed by the same teachers used for U.S. and allied troops who operate the system. Around 90 Ukrainians will be trained, which is the same number of troops the U.S. uses to operate its PATRIOT batteries. \nRyder also stressed the importance of not cutting too many corners in the training process, citing lessons learned from watching the Russians struggle with combined arms maneuvers due to poor training and techniques, leaving their advanced equipment less useful.\n“My understanding is that nothing will be done that would prevent this from being employed to the maximum, most effective way possible,” Ryder said. “If give you a piece of equipment, I’m simply giving you a piece of equipment, but if I give you the equipment and I give you the training, I now give you a capability. So that’s really essential here to ensuring that not only do the Ukrainians have the equipment they need to fight, but also the training that’s going to enable them to operate it on the frontline.” \n", "中文原文": "据报道，2022年11月15日，乌克兰军队在该国南部地区击落了一枚俄罗斯导弹的残骸。照片来自乌克兰武装部队总参谋部通过脸书。几个月来，乌克兰一直面临俄罗斯导弹和无人机的接二连三的袭击，使其苏联时代的防空紧张。但随着美国及其盟友努力向乌克兰提供升级的技术来防御这些袭击，一项开源情报分析发现，俄罗斯导弹拥有大量自己的美国技术。在1月10日的一次简报中，皇家战略研究所的分析师详细说明了俄罗斯有多少导弹拥有美国和其他西方部件，尽管实施了出口管制。“所有这些设备都绝对充满了西方组件，”RUSI开源情报和分析研究组主任詹姆斯·伯恩说。“对我们来说，这非常有趣，非常令人惊讶。我们在这些系统中发现的几乎所有东西都是由美国公司制造和设计的。“布莱恩说，RUSI能够进行广泛的评估，部分原因是乌克兰提供了它击落、捕获或收集的武器，供分析师检查。伯恩说：“随着战争进程的进展，我们在这些平台上看到的许多组件以及我们后来在这些平台上看到的许多组件都是相对较新的。”“俄罗斯人已经做了很长时间了，他们现在还在做。”伯恩说，它在俄罗斯武器中发现的两个最大的技术供应商是总部位于美国的模拟器件和德克萨斯仪器公司--这些技术中的许多都有非军事应用，这使得对它们出口的打击更加困难。根据英国智库的说法，俄罗斯有各种向该国走私技术的计划，包括第三国的幌子公司。自2022年2月莫斯科开始再次入侵以来，美国已经实施了广泛的出口管制，以防止美国技术和商品流向俄罗斯。这是美国在2014年俄罗斯最初入侵乌克兰后采取的其他措施之一，包括加强对武器技术的出口控制。不过，按照鲁西的说法，俄罗斯在乌克兰使用的一些武器是过去一年制造的。伯恩说：“一直以来，人们对获得美国技术有着巨大的兴趣。”“尽管俄罗斯努力建立这种国内本土半导体产业，尽管宣传，尽管关于进口替代的讨论，但他们没有成功做到这一点。我个人认为他们永远不会真正成功做到这一点。因此，这使得他们非常严重地依赖外国技术。“美国商务部没有立即回复《空军与太空部队》杂志就美国出口管制的有效性发表评论的请求。随着俄罗斯今年冬天继续轰炸乌克兰的基础设施，美国及其盟友寻求为乌克兰提供一个一体化的现代空中和导弹防御网络。最近，美国和德国都承诺给乌克兰人一个更先进的系统：爱国者防空系统。1月10日，五角大楼新闻秘书帕特里克·赖德准将宣布，乌克兰士兵最早将于下周开始在希尔堡训练操作爱国者，希尔堡是美国军队在该系统上接受训练的地方。这样做将要求乌克兰从前线撤出一些军队；在美国爱国者电池上的训练需要几个月的时间，尽管可以通过跳过一些被认为不重要的步骤来加快训练。赖德说：“这些部队离开线的时间越长，他们实际上就没有参与战斗，所以（我们）正试图与乌克兰人合作，看看我们能做些什么来加快训练时间表。”“就训练的样子而言，它将包括在教室里的训练，它将包括在爱国者系统上的训练，当然，在他们在战场上实际部署能力之前，也包括在模拟实验室里的训练。”赖德说，乌克兰计划向希尔堡派遣已经接受过防空训练的士兵，在那里乌克兰军队将接受操作该系统的美国和盟军军队使用的相同教师的指导。大约90名乌克兰人将接受训练，这与美国用来操作爱国者电池的军队人数相同。赖德还强调了在训练过程中不要偷工减料的重要性，他引用了从观察俄罗斯人因训练和技术差而在联合武器机动中挣扎中吸取的教训，这使得他们的先进设备不太有用。赖德说：“我的理解是，没有什么能阻止这一点得到最大限度、最有效的利用。”“如果给你一块等分", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯对乌克兰使用的导弹“绝对充满”美国技术", "英文整编": "On January 10th, the Royal Joint Services Research Institute (RUSI) issued a briefing saying that although the United States has strict export control to Russia, some Russian missiles are equipped with weapon components developed and produced by the United States and other Western countries.

That large area is needed since the spacecraft will be flying out to Jupiter’s distance from the sun, where the sunlight is only a few percent as powerful as at Earth. “That enables Lucy to travel further away from the sun than any other solar-powered spacecraft to date,” said Katie Oakman, Lucy structures and mechanisms lead at Lockheed Martin Space, at the Oct. 14 briefing. Lockheed was the prime contractor for Lucy, although the solar arrays were built by Northrop Grumman.\nIn the vicinity of the Earth, Lucy’s panels can generate 18 kilowatts of power. However, when flying by the Trojan asteroids that are the destination of the mission, the arrays will produce only 500 watts of power, still sufficient to operate the spacecraft and its three main instruments.\nShe added there was no specific design requirement for circular arrays versus more conventional rectangular ones, but that those offered the most area while fitting in the confines of the Atlas payload fairing. “This particular design really enables us to stow up closely and tightly next to the spacecraft for launch,” she said. “Having any particular shape other than this really unique design wouldn’t enable us to get to that 51-meter-squared of active cell area and still fit within the launch vehicle fairing.”\nIt’s unclear if the problem will affect other work to check out the spacecraft after its launch.

Credit: Jaoui et al.\nMagic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a graphene-based material with a unique structure, consisting of two graphene sheets layered on top of each other with a misalignment of approximately 1.1°. This unique structure has been found to host various interesting states, including correlated insulating states and unconventional superconductivity.\nPast studies examining MATBG also unveiled the emergence of what is known as a \"strange\" metal regime in the proximity of the superconducting dome, as well as a significantly enhanced electron-phonon coupling. While these observations were confirmed by later works, the exact mechanisms underpinning them remain unclear.\nResearchers at the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, the National Institute for Material Sciences, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have recently taken a closer look at these properties of MATBG using a different, low temperature phase diagram than those utilized in previous works. Their paper, published in Nature Physics, gathered new valuable insight about the material's quantum critical behavior.\n\"Early reports on the electrical transport properties of twisted bilayer graphene revealed two fascinating features: the emergence of a so-called 'strange' metal regime in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and a sharply enhanced electron-phonon coupling,\" Alexandre Jaoui, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"Yet, both features share, under certain conditions, a common signature: a linear-in-temperature resistivity. One question that arose was: can a single microscopic mechanism, electrons scattering off phonons, account for both previous observations? Or is this signature, in the low temperature region, pointing to the existence of additional scattering centers affecting charge carriers?\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nA schematic phase diagram of the metallic ground state of hole-doped magic-angle graphene with a single superconducting dome. Credit: Jaoui et al.\nThe answers to these so-far elusive questions can only be found by examining MATBG at low temperatures, where phonons (i.e., quasiparticles associated with waves such as sound or vibration) are suppressed. In the MATBG devices reported in previous literature, however, the metallic ground state was typically hidden by an array of phase transitions.\n\"We proposed to take advantage of our 'screened' devices, in which the correlated insulators are suppressed, to study magic-angle graphene with a much simpler low-temperature phase diagram: a single superconducting dome enclosed in a metallic phase,\" Jaoui explained. \"This allowed us to focus on the latter state.\"\nTo fabricate their MATBG structure, Jaoui and his colleagues used a 'cut-and-stack' method often used by research teams examining 2D heterostructures. To encapsulate their device they used a thin layer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).\n\"The proximity of the graphene layers to the metallic gate allows us to suppress the low temperature insulating states and thus grants further access to the metallic ground state,\" Jaoui said. \"We then collected measurements using conventional quantum transport techniques (i.e., DC electrical transport).\"\nFrom conventional to strange metal behavior in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene\nThe research team who carried out the study. From left to right: Ipsita Das, Alexandre Jaoui, Jaime Díez-Mérida, Giorgio di Battista, Dmitri K. Efetov\nThe measurements gathered by Jaoui and his colleagues confirmed the occurrence of the same 'strange' metal behavior reported in previous studies (i.e., a linear-in-T resistivity with a Planckian scattering rate). However, the team's study shows that this behavior extends to temperatures far below the Bloch-Grüneisen temperature while the system has a finite Fermi temperature. Moreover, their findings highlight an additional signature of strange metallicity, namely an enhanced linear magnetoresistance.\n\"Perhaps the most interesting part of this study, however, is the recovery of the archetypal behavior of a disordered dilute & correlated metal, the Fermi liquid behavior, away from the superconducting dome,\" Jaoui said. \"This evolution suggests that fluctuations of a yet-to-be-determined nature dominate the metallic ground state in the vicinity of the superconducting dome and drive the low-temperature linear resistivity.\"\nOverall, the findings gathered by this team of researchers suggest that quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG might be related. In the future, their work could inspire new studies examining this possibility and the quantum-critical phase observed in this study further.\n\"We are now investigating the evolution of the metallic ground state as a function of the 'twist-angle' of twisted bilayer graphene,\" Jaoui added. \"This is, in a very simplistic manner, a knob tuning the strength of the electronic correlations. We will soon publish further report on the metallic ground state of twisted bilayer graphene.\"\n", "中文原文": "由研究人员创建的设备的光学图像。功劳：贾维等人。魔角扭曲双层石墨烯(MATBG)是一种具有独特结构的石墨烯基材料，由两片石墨烯以约1.1°的错位相互层叠而成。这种独特的结构被发现承载了各种有趣的态，包括关联绝缘态和非常规超导。过去对MATBG的研究还揭示了在超导穹顶附近出现了一种被称为“奇怪”的金属机制，以及显著增强的电子-声子耦合。虽然这些观察被后来的工作证实，但支撑它们的确切机制仍不清楚。巴塞罗那科学技术研究所、国家材料科学研究所和麻省理工学院(MIT)的研究人员最近使用了一种不同于以前工作中使用的低温相图，对MATBG的这些性质进行了更仔细的研究。他们的论文发表在《自然物理学》上，收集了关于这种材料的量子临界行为的新的有价值的见解。开展这项研究的研究人员之一亚历山大·贾维（Alexandre Jaoui）告诉Phys.org，“关于扭曲双层石墨烯电输运性质的早期报告揭示了两个迷人的特征：在超导穹顶附近出现了所谓的‘奇怪’金属区，以及急剧增强的电子-声子耦合。”然而，在某些条件下，这两种特征都有一个共同的特征：温度内的线性电阻率。由此产生的一个问题是：一种单一的微观机制--电子从声子上散射--能解释以前的两种观察吗？或者，在低温区，这种特征表明存在着影响电荷载流子的附加散射中心？魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为单超导穹顶空穴掺杂幻角石墨烯金属基态相图。功劳：贾维等人。这些迄今为止难以捉摸的问题的答案只能通过在低温下检查MATBG来找到，在低温下，声子（即与声音或振动等波相关的准粒子）被抑制。然而，在以往文献报道的MATBG器件中，金属基态通常被一系列相变所隐藏。“我们提议利用我们的‘屏蔽’设备，其中相关绝缘体被抑制，以一种更简单的低温相图来研究魔角石墨烯：一个封闭在金属相中的单一超导穹顶，”贾维解释说。“这让我们可以专注于后一种状态。”为了制造他们的MATBG结构，Jaoui和他的同事使用了一种“切割叠加”方法，这种方法通常是研究团队在研究二维异质结构时使用的。为了封装他们的器件，他们使用了一层薄薄的六方氮化硼(hBN)。Jaoui说：“石墨烯层靠近金属栅使我们能够抑制低温绝缘态，从而进一步获得金属基态。”然后，我们使用传统的量子传输技术（即直流电传输）收集测量结果。魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为进行这项研究的研究小组。从左到右：伊普斯塔·达斯、亚历山大·贾维、海梅·迪耶斯-梅里达、乔治·迪·巴蒂斯塔、德米特里·埃费托夫Jaoui和他的同事收集的测量结果证实了以前研究中报道的同样的“奇怪”金属行为的发生（即，线性电阻率与普朗克散射率）。然而，该小组的研究表明，这种行为扩展到远低于布洛赫-格吕内森温度的温度，而该系统有有限的费米温度。此外，他们的发现突出了一个奇怪的金属性的额外特征，即增强的线性磁电阻。“然而，这项研究最有趣的部分可能是在超导穹顶之外恢复无序稀相关金属的原型行为，即费米液体行为，”Jaoui说。“这一演化表明，一种尚未确定的性质的涨落主导了超导穹顶附近的金属基态，并驱动了低温线性电阻率。”总的来说，这组研究人员收集的发现表明，MATBG中的量子涨落和超导电性可能有关。在未来，他们的工作可能会激发新的研究，进一步检验这种可能性和在这项研究中观察到的量子临界阶段。“我们现在正在研究金属基态的演化，作为扭曲双层石墨烯‘扭曲角’的函数，”Jaoui补充道。“这是以一种非常简单的方式，", "中文源标题": "魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中从常规到奇异的金属行为", "英文整编": "Magic angle twisted double-layer graphene (MATBG) is a graphene-based material, which has a unique structure composed of two graphene sheets superimposed, and the dislocation angle is about 1. 1 °. This unique structure makes it have many excellent properties, including excellent insulation and superconductivity.Previous studies have revealed two characteristics of MATBG, one is the metal region near the superconducting dome, and the other is the significantly enhanced electron-phonon coupling phenomenon. Although these observations were later confirmed, the exact mechanism supporting them is still unclear. The answers to these questions can only be tried by checking MATBG at low temperature. However, it has been reported that the phonons in the ground state of metal in MATBG components are usually hidden by a series of phase transitions. To solve this problem, researchers from MIT cooperated with Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology and National Institute of Materials Science to design a shielding device, in which related insulators were suppressed, so as to study magic angle graphene with simpler low-temperature phase diagram.To make MATBG structures, the team adopted the \"cut stack\" method often used when examining two-dimensional heterostructures. The proximity of graphene layer to metal gate enables it to suppress the low-temperature insulation state, thus further entering the metal ground state, and then collecting the measured values using traditional quantum transmission technology.The results show that the linear magnetoresistance of the structural material is significantly enhanced. In addition, it is found that the material has Fermi liquid behavior, which indicates that the fluctuation of undetermined properties dominates the metal ground state near the superconducting dome and promotes the linear resistivity at low temperature.In a word, by analyzing the collected research results, it can be concluded that the correlation between quantum fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG is very strong. In the future, the team will carry out new research to test this possibility and further observe the quantum critical stage found in this study."}, {"中文标题": "美国开发出基于光频梳技术的芯片级碳化硅宽带光源", "情报来源": "物理学组织网站", "时间": "2022年3月18日", "整编内容": "近日，由美国卡内基梅隆大学电子与计算机工程系的一个研究小组开发出一种基于光学频率梳技术的芯片级碳化硅宽带光源，该光源一般被用作磨料或用于高温高压下工作的电子设备。光频梳负责测量红外线、紫外线、温室气体、原子钟和疾病，就像一把测量光线的尺子。而碳化硅因其独特的性质成为一种非常有前途的材料，可用于量子应用。在新研究中，研究人员利用碳化硅和光频梳技术在克莱尔·贝尔图奇纳米技术实验室制造出了尺寸小于0.1 mm的微型光学设备，大约相当于一张纸的厚度。研究人员表示，设备的制造过程是经过精心优化的，以确定产生具有光滑表面的微小环形结构。由于共振效应，被限制在这些微环中的光经历了显著的功率增强，共振效应足以引起克尔光学非线性响应。该研究使强大信息处理器的研发成为可能，为开发全新微型电子设备铺平了道路。", "关键词": "光学频率梳 碳化硅 宽带光源 量子应用 信息处理器 共振效应 克尔效应 光学非线性相应", "整编机构": "国家工业信息安全发展研究中心", "源网址": "https://phys.org/news/2022-03-chip-scale-broadband-source-silicon-carbide.html", "源标题": "A chip-scale broadband light source in silicon carbide", "原文": "Optical frequency combs have changed science and technology as we know it.

Ultimately, such methods could significantly aid the design, prediction, analysis and control of complex physical systems.\nSo far, traditional methods based on linear theory achieved poor performances when reconstructing global fields for complex physical systems or processes, particularly when only a limited amount of sensor data is available or when sensors are randomly positioned. In recent years, computer scientists have thus been exploring the potential of alternative methods for global field reconstruction, including deep learning models.\nResearchers at Keio University in Japan, University of California- Los Angeles and other institutes in the U.S. have recently developed a new deep learning tool that can accurately reconstruct global fields without the need for extensive and highly organized sensor data. This method, introduced in a paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence, could open new interesting possibilities for several areas of research, including geophysics, astrophysics and atmospheric science.\n\"Achieving accurate and robust global situational awareness of a complex time-evolving field from a limited number of sensors has been a long-standing challenge,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues wrote in their paper. \"This reconstruction problem is especially difficult when sensors are sparsely positioned in a seemingly random or unorganized manner, which is often encountered in a range of scientific and engineering problems.\"\nWhen studying atmospheric phenomena, astrophysical processes and other complex physical systems, researchers often only have access to data collected by a limited number of sensors positioned in unorganized ways. In some instances, these sensors can also be moving and may go offline for some periods of time.\nThis lack of ideal sensor data has so far made it difficult to reconstruct global fields for these complex systems. While deep learning techniques have achieved some promising results, implementing them can often be highly expensive and computationally demanding.\nThe global field reconstruction technique developed by Fukami and his colleagues merges deep learning with Voronoi tessellation, a way of representing and describing biological structures or physical systems. In the past, Voronoi tessellations or diagrams have been used in many areas of science and engineering.\n\"We propose a data-driven spatial field recovery technique founded on a structured grid-based deep-learning approach for arbitrary positioned sensors of any numbers,\" Kai Fukami and his colleagues explained in their paper. \"We consider the use of Voronoi tessellation to obtain a structured-grid representation from sensor locations, enabling the computationally tractable use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\"\nThe technique created by the researchers incorporates the data collected by sparse sensors into a CNN, approximating local information onto a structured representation, while retaining data related to the location of sensors. To do this, it constructs a Voronoi tessellation of the unstructured dataset and then adds the input data field corresponding to the location of the sensors, implementing it as a mask.\nTwo advantageous features of this method for global field reconstruction are that it is compatible with deep learning-based techniques that have proved promising for advanced image processing and it can also be implemented with an arbitrary number of sensors. So far, the researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach by using it to reconstruct global fields using three different sets of sensor data, namely unsteady wake flow, geophysical data and 3D turbulence data.\nIn contrast with previously proposed methods, the tool developed by Fukami and his colleagues also works with data collected by a random number of moving sensors.

We think NASA is the right place initially, we’re open for other options and debate on this.”\nThe two-hour “listening session” provided industry reps, scientists and interested members of the public with an opportunity to weigh in on the White House’s “National Orbital Debris Research and Development Plan” [PDF] issued last January in the waning days of the Trump administration.\nIn early November, the Biden administrationannouncedthat OSTP would be updating the plan, which had been criticized by a number of experts as simply touting more research on already widely understood problems, and opened a public comment period through the end of the year. The request specifically asked for input on “what R&D areas are priorities for government-sponsored initiatives/coordination, the roles of academia, nonprofit, and industry actors in addressing these actions, and potential avenues for coordination between actors across public and private sectors.”\nTo follow up, on Dec. 17 OSTP announced [PDF] that it would hold two town-hall type virtual opportunities for oral comments as follows:\n·Jan. 13, Debris Mediation:“the active or passive manipulation of debris objects to reduce or eliminate the risk they pose to operational space assets. This may include fully removing debris from orbit, moving debris from orbits that pose a high risk to operational spacecraft into lower-risk orbits, and finding ways to repurpose or recycle existing debris.”\n·Jan. 20, Debris Mitigation:which refers to “limiting the creation of new debris through deliberate spacecraft and launch vehicle design choices.”\nThe Thursday meeting at times resembled the TV comedy Seinfeld’s Festivus celebration’s “airing of grievances,” and at other times descended into what could only be seen as shameless self-promotion of various tech companies’ wares. That said, there was widespread accord on a number of recommendations.\nFor example, aside from the issues of responsibility and funding, numerous commenters noted the need to lower the 25-year time deadline for removing defunct satellites from LEO — which the Trump administration’s2019 rewrite of US space debris mitigation guidelinesretained after a fierce inter-agency fight.\nAnother common thread was on the need for the Commerce Department to quit stalling on providing NOAA’sOffice of Space Commerceadequate funding and more authority to take on the role of civil space traffic management, relieving the Defense Department of the job of warning commercial and non-US operators of potential on-orbit collisions, including with debris.\nIndeed, President Joe Biden’s nominee for DoD assistant secretary of space policy, John Plumb,in his confirmation hearing Thursday,called space traffic management “absolutely essential” and pledged to help make the transfer of responsibility happen.\n", "中文原文": "华盛顿：沮丧的行业官员、科学家和专家正在推动美国政府承担起清理太空环境的责任--从联邦机构创建的Debris开始，其中一些可以追溯到太空时代的早期。“政府能做的最重要的事情之一是，近地轨道上28%的碎片是由美国政府制造的。你知道，这是赢得冷战的一部分。探索初创公司旅行者太空控股公司在轨服务副总裁乔纳森·戈夫（Jonathan Goff）周四在白宫科学技术政策办公室主办的一次市政厅式的太空碎片虚拟会议上表示：“像赢得冷战中制造的许多其他环境混乱一样，这一混乱也应该得到清理。”奥巴马政府时期五角大楼太空政策前负责人道格·洛弗罗（Doug Loverro）在会议上表示：“如果美国海军有一艘废弃的船只停在主权水域，造成安全隐患，海军将出去抓住那艘船……或者更有可能雇佣一家打捞公司……继续把那艘船带回岸上。”“这种责任对航海国家来说已经存在了几十年。我不知道为什么我们没有看到政府对他们今天在太空中被遗弃的船只和尸体负有同样的责任。“一些与会者表示，承担责任包括为新兴技术的进一步发展和在轨演示提供更多联邦政府资金，以帮助启动市场，为谨慎的投资者改善商业案例。洛韦罗补充说：“如果政府对此负责，并表示他们将为人们支付费用，让他们继续处理那些废弃的船只和那些废弃的（火箭）尸体，我们已经谈到的许多商业方面都将是清楚的。”几位与会者指出，国防部通过利用小企业创新研究/小企业技术转让赠款等资助机构，努力刺激所谓主动碎片清除领域的技术创新，作为包括国家海洋和大气管理局(NOAA)和美国航天局在内的其他机构效仿的模式。然而，与会者说，处理日益增长的碎片问题不仅需要资金，还需要建立一个机构协调中心或一个机构间小组来协调跨政府的行动。“逃避问题或拖延问题不再是一种选择。碎片清除初创公司Astroscale负责全球空间政策和政府关系的副总裁慈善机构·韦登（Charity Weeden）表示：“积极管理空间环境需要我们立即关注，政府的作用应该是在支持发展方面发挥领导作用--不仅仅是技术，还有财政激励和政策基础--以允许补救服务蓬勃发展。”“补救是一个跨部门的问题，”她补充道。“因此，需要一个最高级别的协调员，他可以考虑所有部门机构将参与的方面。我们认为美国宇航局最初是正确的地方，我们对其他选择持开放态度，并就此进行辩论。“两个小时的“倾听会”为行业代表、科学家和感兴趣的公众提供了一个机会，对白宫去年1月在特朗普政府执政末期发布的“国家轨道碎片研究和发展计划”[PDF]进行权衡。11月初，拜登政府宣布，OSTP将更新该计划，该计划被一些专家批评为只是吹捧对已经广泛理解的问题进行更多研究，并在年底前开启了公众评论期。该请求特别要求就“哪些研发领域是政府发起的倡议/协调的优先事项，学术界、非营利组织和行业行为者在处理这些行动中的作用，以及公共和私营部门行为者之间协调的潜在途径”提供投入。作为后续行动，12月17日，OSTP宣布[PDF]将举行两次市政厅类型的口头评论虚拟机会，具体如下：·1月。13、碎片调解：“主动或被动操纵碎片物体以减少或消除其对运行中的空间资产构成的风险。这可能包括从轨道上完全清除碎片，将碎片从对运行中的航天器构成高风险的轨道转移到风险较低的轨道，以及找到重新利用或回收现有碎片的方法。“·1月。20、碎片减缓：指“通过精心选择航天器和运载火箭的设计，限制新碎片的产生”。周四的会议有时类似于电视喜剧宋飞节庆祝活动的“发泄不满”，有时则演变成wha", "中文源标题": "工业界呼吁白宫“立即”采取行动清理太空垃圾", "英文整编": "On January 13th, at the virtual conference on space debris held by the White House, industry participants said that cleaning up space debris should be one of the most important issues for the US government.

The stored pictures will also include information and metadata deemed necessary or useful for their military usage in test and/or research activities.\nOnce established and fully accessible, the database can be used, for instance, for target recognition, the assessment and improvement of camouflage effectiveness, the testing and enhancement of sensors in different terrains, the generation of synthetic images or the support of modelling and simulation activities.\nThe exercise participants came from different expert communities with an interest in the ETDB, particularly scientists and technicians specialised in Optronics and Radar sensor design (including materials) and performance prediction, design, development and testing of new camouflage, visible and infrared signature and Radar Cross Section mitigation solutions. The future dataset can be employed by the Ministries of Defence of all participating Member States for R&T initiatives as well as for operational and training purposes. The multinational field trial was therefore an excellent opportunity for those experts to meet and explore potential cooperation opportunities among European defence test centres.\nThe event was organised in the framework of EDA’s Defence Test & Evaluation Base (DTEB) initiative, which was launched in 2010 to collect, share and harmonise defence test & evaluation standards and procedures at European level.

KIZILELMA means “red apple” in Turkish, but refers to an expression in Turkish mythology that symbolizes goals, ideas, or dreams that are far away, but whose attraction is greater the further away they are.\nSelcuk Bayraktar, Baykar’s Chief Technology Officer, also posted the photographs and noted that his company launched another brand-new product three and a half years after beginning manufacturing of Akinci UCAV.\nWith the 5th generation fighters, the world is witnessing the end of manned fighters. No new manned combat aircraft will be developed. Unmanned systems will increasingly become the strongest elements on the battlefield in the future.

The announcement came along with several surprising renderings showing the future Turkish TCG Anadolu helicopter landing dock. This was an unexpected development, as Baykar is reportedly working on the TB3 Bayraktar UCAV to be deployed aboard TCG Anadolu, and MIUS will be a second option for aircraft operations.\nAfter being removed from the F35 JSF project, the Turkish government decided to transform the future TCG Anadolu into a carrier ship for attack drones. In a March interview, SSB Head Ismail Demir stated that after the project is completed, between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 drones will be sent to Anadolu. After seven months, he disclosed in a TV interview that LHD Anadolu will house up to 80 drones.\nConsidering a future in which air combat will be dominated by unmanned technology, the “BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA” developed entirely within Turkish borders will certainly play an increasingly important role in the future.\nAccording to the information provided by the company, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be a force to be reckoned with, primarily due to its aggressive maneuverability and stealth capability against radar. In addition, the BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA will be able to take off and land on aircraft carriers with short runways and conduct missions with internally carried munitions.\nThe first BAYRAKTAR KIZILELMA prototype will use a turbofan to fly at Mach 0.8 near the speed of sound; later prototypes will fly at supersonic speeds. A SATCOM antenna will enable autonomous control via satellite, and MIUS can remain airborne for up to 5 hours. The unmanned jet will have 6 tons of takeoff weight and up to 1500 kg payload capacity.\nBaykar Defense and Ukraine’s Ivchenko-Progress signed a contract for Bayraktar KIZILELMA to supply AI-322F turbofan engines for the unmanned jet during the Defense, Aerospace, and Defense Exhibition SAHA EXPO 2021, which was held in Istanbul from Nov. 10-13, 2021.\nBayraktar KIZILELMA will be equipped with an AESA radar developed by Turkey’s leading defence company Aselsan and will be capable of launching indigenous Bozdogan and Gokdogan air-to-air missiles.

A well-known example is superconductivity: below a critical temperature some metals and other substances conduct electric current without any losses. At even lower temperatures additional quantum-physical effects can occur, which are relevant for basic research as well as for applications in quantum technologies.\nHowever, to reach such temperatures—less than a thousandth of a degree above the absolute zero of 0 Kelvin, or -273.15 degrees Celsius—is exceedingly difficult. Physicists in the research group of Prof. Dr. Dominik Zumbühl at the University of Basel, together with colleagues at the VTT Technical Research Centre in Finland and at Lancaster University in England, have now set a new low-temperature record. Their results have just been published in Physical Review Research.\nCooling with magnetic fields\n\"Cooling a material down very strongly is not the only problem,\" explains Christian Scheller, a senior scientist in Zumbühl's laboratory. \"One also has to reliably measure those extremely low temperatures.\"\nIn their experiments, the researchers cooled a tiny electric circuit made of copper on a silicon chip by first exposing it to a strong magnetic field, then cooling it with a special fridge known as a cryostat and eventually ramping down the magnetic field slowly. In this way, the nuclear spins of the copper atoms in the chip were initially aligned like small magnets and effectively cooled down even further when, at the end, ramping down the magnetic field led to a decrease in their magnetic energy.\n\"We've been working with such techniques for a decade now, but so far the lowest temperatures that could be reached in this way were limited by the vibrations of the fridge,\" says Omid Sharifi Sedeh, who was involved in the experiments as a Ph.D. student.\nThose vibrations, which arise from the continuous compression and rarefaction of the cooling agent helium in a so-called \"dry\" cryostat, significantly heat up the chip. To avoid that, the researchers developed a new sample holder that is wired so strongly that the chip can be cooled to very low temperatures despite the vibrations.\nRobust thermometer\nTo accurately measure those temperatures, Zumbühl and his collaborators improved a special thermometer that is integrated into the circuit. The thermometer consists of copper islands that are connected by so-called tunnel junctions. Electrons can move through those junctions more or less easily depending on the temperature.\nThe physicists found a method to make the thermometer more robust against material defects and, at the same time, more temperature-sensitive. This allowed them, finally, to measure a temperature of just 220 millionths of a degree above absolute zero (220 micro Kelvin).\nIn the future, the Basel researchers want to use their method to lower the temperature by another factor of ten and, in the long run, also cool semiconductor materials. That will pave the way towards studies of new quantum effects and diverse applications, such as the optimization of qubits in quantum computers.\n", "中文原文": "当材料被冷却到极低的温度时，它们的行为往往与室温下的行为有很大的不同。一个众所周知的例子是超导电性：在临界温度以下，一些金属和其他物质传导电流而没有任何损耗。即使在更低的温度下，也会发生额外的量子物理效应，这与基础研究以及量子技术的应用有关。然而，要达到这样的温度--比绝对零度0开尔文或零下273.15摄氏度高出不到千分之一摄氏度--是极其困难的。巴塞尔大学Dominik Zumbühl教授研究组的物理学家，以及芬兰VTT技术研究中心和英国兰卡斯特大学的同事，现在创造了一项新的低温记录。他们的结果刚刚发表在《物理评论研究》上。磁场冷却Zumbühl实验室的高级科学家Christian Scheller解释说：“非常强烈地冷却材料并不是唯一的问题。”“人们还必须可靠地测量这些极低的温度.”在他们的实验中，研究人员首先将一个由铜制成的硅芯片上的微小电路暴露在强磁场中，然后用一个被称为低温恒温器的特殊冰箱冷却，最后慢慢降低磁场，以此来冷却它。通过这种方式，芯片中铜原子的核自旋最初像小磁铁一样排列，当最后磁场下降导致它们的磁能下降时，有效地进一步冷却。“我们已经研究这种技术十年了，但到目前为止，这种方式可以达到的最低温度受到冰箱振动的限制，”奥米德·沙里菲·塞德说，他作为一名博士生参与了这项实验。这些振动是由冷却介质氦在所谓的“干燥”低温恒温器中的持续压缩和稀薄引起的，它显著地加热了芯片。为了避免这种情况，研究人员开发了一种新的样品支架，这种支架连接得非常牢固，即使有振动，芯片也可以被冷却到非常低的温度。鲁棒温度计为了精确测量这些温度，Zumbühl和他的合作者改进了一种集成在电路中的特殊温度计。温度计由铜岛组成，这些铜岛通过所谓的隧道结连接起来。电子可以或多或少地通过这些结，这取决于温度。物理学家们发现了一种方法，使温度计对材料缺陷更加坚固，同时对温度更加敏感。这使得他们最终能够测量到绝对零度以上220百万分之一度（220微开尔文）的温度。在未来，巴塞尔的研究人员希望用他们的方法将温度降低10倍，从长远来看，也可以冷却半导体材料。这将为研究新的量子效应和各种应用铺平道路，如量子计算机中量子比特的优化。", "中文源标题": "发展中的超冷电路：物理学家建立了一种新型的金属箔封装的低温记录光阴极", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers in University of Basel, Switzerland have set a new record for low temperature work of ultra-low temperature integrated circuits.

It is expected to become the world’s most powerful rocket-ship. “Starship was designed from the onset to be able to carry more than 100 tons of cargo to Mars and the Moon. The cargo version can also be used for rapid point-to-point Earth transport. Various payload bay configurations are available and allow for fully autonomous deployment of cargo to Earth, Lunar, or Martian surfaces,” the company said.\nSpaceX’s Starship launch vehicle has many potential uses and capabilities that will enable access to space like never before. The cargo version of Starship will be able to launch entire satellite constellations in a single launch inside its payload bay. For perspective, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 can carry up to 60 Starlink satellites in a tight configuration inside its 5.2-meter diameter fairing, Starship will be able to carry 400 Starlink satellites to deploy in a single launch inside its fairing. Starship will be capable of deploying giant spacecraft to space inside its clamshell-like fairing, which has an outer diameter of 9-meters –“the largest usable payload volume of any current or in development launcher,” the company says. SpaceX also plans to design an extended Starship volume capability for payloads requiring up to 22-meters of height.\nStarship will also be able to capture satellites already in orbit to be repaired or brought back to be disposed of on Earth, according to SpaceX’s Starship User Guide. “Fully-reusable Starship and Super Heavy systems are expected to allow for space-based activities that have not been possible since the retirement of the Space Shuttle and Space Transportation System, or have never been possible before. With a fully reusable Starship, satellites can be captured and repaired in Orbit, returned to Earth, or transferred to a new operational orbit,” SpaceX’s vehicle guide says. This will be possible with Starship’s large clamshell-like cargo door mechanism that opens and closes, as shown in the image below. The clamshell door can be modified to “chomp up” old satellites and space junk orbiting Earth. “We can fly Starship around space and chomp up debris with the moving fairing door,” SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in July 2021.\nThis clamshell-like fairing could enable engineers to develop a mechanism to gather satellites to repair, as well as pick up other orbiting objects that are no longer in use. SpaceX President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell says Starship could help clean up space. “Starship is an extraordinary new vehicle capability… Not only will it decrease the costs of access to space, it’s the vehicle that would transport people from Earth to Mars,” Shotwell said last year, “But it also has the capability of taking cargo and crew at the same time, and so it’s quite possible that we could leverage Starship to go to some of these dead rocket bodies — other people’s rocket’s, of course.

Scientists are therefore drawing on how the brain and its interconnected neurons function for inspiration in designing innovative computing technologies. They foresee that these brain-inspired computing systems, will be more energy-efficient than conventional ones, as well as better at performing machine-learning tasks.\nMuch like neurons, which are responsible for both data storage and data processing in the brain, scientists want to combine storage and processing in a single type of electronic component, known as a memristor. Their hope is that this will help to achieve greater efficiency because moving data between the processor and the storage, as conventional computers do, is the main reason for the high energy consumption in machine-learning applications.\nResearchers at ETH Zurich, Empa and the University of Zurich have now developed an innovative concept for a memristor that can be used in a far wider range of applications than existing memristors. \"There are different operation modes for memristors, and it is advantageous to be able to use all these modes depending on an artificial neural network's architecture,\" explains ETH Zurich postdoc Rohit John. \"But previous conventional memristors had to be configured for one of these modes in advance.\" The new memristors can now easily switch between two operation modes while in use: a mode in which the signal grows weaker over time and dies (volatile mode), and one in which the signal remains constant (non-volatile mode).\nJust like in the brain\n\"These two operation modes are also found in the human brain,\" John says. On the one hand, stimuli at the synapses are transmitted from neuron to neuron with biochemical neurotransmitters. These stimuli start out strong and then gradually become weaker. On the other hand, new synaptic connections to other neurons form in the brain while we learn. These connections are longer-lasting.\nJohn, who is a postdoc in the group headed by ETH Zurich/Empa researcher Maksym Kovalenko, was awarded an ETH fellowship for outstanding postdoctoral researchers in 2020. John conducted this research together with Yi?it Demira?, a doctoral student in Giacomo Indiveri's group at the Institute for Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.\nSemiconductor material known from solar cells\nThe memristors the researchers have developed are made of halide perovskite nanocrystals, a semiconductor material known primarily from its use in photovoltaic cells. \"The 'nerve conduction' in these new memristors is mediated by temporarily or permanently stringing together silver ions from an electrode to form a nanofilament penetrating the perovskite structure through which current can flow,\" explains Kovalenko.\nThis process can be regulated to make the silver-ion filament either thin, so that it gradually breaks back down into individual silver ions (volatile mode), or thick and permanent (non-volatile mode). This is controlled by the intensity of the current conducted on the memristor: Applying a weak current activates the volatile mode, while a strong current activates the non-volatile mode.\nNew toolkit for neuroinformaticians\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first memristor that can be reliably switched between volatile and non-volatile modes on demand,\" Demira? says. This means that in the future, computer chips can be manufactured with memristors that enable both modes. This is a significance advance because it is usually not possible to combine several different types of memristors on one chip.\nWithin the scope of the study, which they recently published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers tested 25 of these new memristors and carried out 20,000 measurements with them. In this way, they were able to simulate a computational problem on a complex network. The problem involved classifying a number of different neuron spikes as one of four predefined patterns.\nBefore these memristors can be used in computer technology, they will need to undergo further optimization. However, such components are also important for research in neuroinformatics, as Indiveri points out: \"These components come closer to real neurons than previous ones. As a result, they help researchers to better test hypotheses in neuroinformatics and hopefully gain a better understanding of the computing principles of real neuronal circuits in humans and animals.\"\n", "中文原文": "与计算机相比，人脑的能源效率高得令人难以置信。因此，科学家们正在研究大脑及其相互连接的神经元的功能，以获得设计创新计算技术的灵感。他们预计，这些受大脑启发的计算系统将比传统的系统更节能，也更擅长执行机器学习任务。就像大脑中负责数据存储和数据处理的神经元一样，科学家们希望将存储和处理结合在一种单一类型的电子元件中，即忆阻器。他们希望这将有助于实现更高的效率，因为像传统计算机一样，在处理器和存储器之间移动数据是机器学习应用中高能耗的主要原因。苏黎世ETH,Empa和苏黎世大学的研究人员现在开发了一种创新的忆阻器概念，该概念可以用于比现有忆阻器更广泛的应用领域。苏黎世ETH博士后Rohit John解释说：“忆阻器有不同的工作模式，根据人工神经网络的架构，能够使用所有这些模式是有利的。”“但是以前的传统忆阻器必须预先为这些模式之一配置.”新的忆阻器现在可以在使用时轻松地在两种工作模式之间切换：一种是信号随时间变弱并消失的模式（易失性模式），另一种是信号保持不变的模式（非易失性模式）。就像在大脑里一样“这两种操作模式也存在于人脑中，”约翰说。一方面，突触上的刺激通过生化神经递质在神经元之间传递。这些刺激开始时很强，然后逐渐变弱。另一方面，当我们学习时，大脑中与其他神经元形成新的突触连接。这些联系更为持久。约翰是ETH苏黎世/Empa研究员马克西姆·科瓦连科（Maksym Kovalenko）领导的研究组的博士后，他在2020年获得了ETH杰出博士后研究员奖学金。约翰与苏黎世大学和苏黎世联邦理工学院神经信息学研究所Giacomo Indiveri小组的博士生Yi？it Demira一起进行了这项研究。已知太阳能电池的半导体材料研究人员开发的忆阻器是由卤化物钙钛矿纳米晶体制成的，这是一种半导体材料，主要是从它在光伏电池中的应用中得知的。科瓦连科解释说：“这些新型忆阻器中的‘神经传导’是通过暂时或永久地将电极上的银离子串在一起，形成穿透钙钛矿结构的纳米丝来介导的，电流可以通过这种结构流动。”这一过程可以被调节，使银离子丝要么变薄，使其逐渐分解成单个银离子（挥发性模式），要么变粗并永久（非挥发性模式）。这是由传导在忆阻器上的电流强度控制的：施加弱电流激活易失性模式，而施加强电流激活非易失性模式。神经信息学家的新工具包“据我们所知，这是第一个可以根据需要在易失性和非易失性模式之间可靠切换的忆阻器，”德米拉？说。这意味着，在未来，计算机芯片可以制造与忆阻器，使两种模式。这是一个重要的进步，因为通常不可能在一个芯片上组合几种不同类型的忆阻器。在最近发表在《自然通讯》杂志上的这项研究范围内，研究人员测试了25个这种新型忆阻器，并用它们进行了2万次测量。这样，他们就能够在一个复杂的网络上模拟一个计算问题。这个问题涉及到将许多不同的神经元尖峰分类为四种预定义模式之一。在这些忆阻器可以用于计算机技术之前，它们将需要经过进一步的优化。然而，这样的组件对于神经信息学的研究也很重要，正如Indiveri所指出的：“这些组件比以前的更接近真实的神经元。因此，它们帮助研究人员更好地检验神经信息学的假设，并有望更好地理解人类和动物真实神经元回路的计算原理。”", "中文源标题": "基于钙钛矿纳米晶的双模忆阻器：一种用于脑启发计算的组件", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland have developed a new type of memristor.

A company-owned Avenger? Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was paired with “digital twin” aircraft to autonomously conduct Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) multi-objective collaborative combat missions. The flights, which took place on Dec. 14, 2022, from GA-ASI’s Desert Horizons flight operations facility in El Mirage, Calif., demonstrate the company’s commitment to maturing its CCA ecosystem for Autonomous Collaborative Platform (ACP) UAS using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). This provides a new and innovative tool for next-generation military platforms to make decisions under dynamic and uncertain real-world conditions.\nThe flight used GA-ASI’s novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture built using agile software development methodology and industry-standard tools such as Docker and Kubernetes to develop and validate three deep learning RL algorithms in an operationally relevant environment. RL agents demonstrated single, multi, and hierarchical agent behaviors. The single agent RL model successfully navigated the live plane while dynamically avoiding threats to accomplish its mission. Multi-agent RL models flew a live and virtual Avenger to collaboratively chase a target while avoiding threats. The hierarchical RL agent used sensor information to select courses of action based on its understanding of the world state. This demonstrated the AI pilot’s ability to successfully process and act on live real-time information independently of a human operator to make mission-critical decisions at the speed of relevance.\nFor the missions, real-time updates were made to flight paths based on fused sensor tracks provided by virtual Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM) models, and RL agent missions were dynamically selected by operators while the plane was airborne, demonstrating live, effective human-machine teaming for autonomy. This live operational data describing AI pilot performance will be fed into GA-ASI’s rapid retraining process for analysis and used to refine future agent performance.\n“The concepts demonstrated by these flights set the standard for operationally relevant mission systems capabilities on CCA platforms,” said GA-ASI Senior Director of Advanced Programs Michael Atwood. “The combination of airborne high-performance computing, sensor fusion, human-machine teaming, and AI pilots making decisions at the speed of relevance shows how quickly GA-ASI’s capabilities are maturing as we move to operationalize autonomy for CCAs.”\nThe team used a government-furnished Collaborative Operations in Denied Environment (CODE) autonomy engine and the government-standard OMS messaging protocol to enable communication between the RL agents and the LVC system. Utilizing government standards such as OMS will make rapid integration of autonomy for CCAs possible.\nIn addition, GA-ASI used a General Dynamics Mission Systems’ EMC2 to run the autonomy architecture.

The project concludes aviation can achieve net zero 2050 through the development of both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green liquid hydrogen technologies.\nTo secure market share on new hydrogen-powered aircraft, UK companies must be ready to demonstrate technologies by 2025. This timescale is key for new zero-carbon emission aircraft to enter service by 2035 and to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nLed by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and backed by the UK government, FlyZero has concluded that green liquid hydrogen is the optimum fuel for zero-carbon emission flight and could power a midsize aircraft with 280 passengers from London to San Francisco directly, or from London to Auckland with just one stop.\nIntroducing a midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 and a narrowbody aircraft by 2037 represents the greatest opportunity for reducing carbon emissions and maximising market impact. Aviation’s carbon emissions would reduce by four gigatons (Gt) up to 2050, equivalent to four years’ of total global aviation carbon emissions, if half the commercial fleet were hydrogen-powered by then, and 14 Gt by 2060.\nThe UK can build on decades of expertise in aerospace innovation to propel a new generation of liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft into our skies, working with global OEMs, governments, and regulatory bodies. With targeted investment in technology, the UK could grow its market share in civil aerospace from 12% today to 19% by 2050, increasing the sector’s gross value added to the economy from ?11bn to ?36bn and the number of aerospace jobs from 116,000 to 154,000.\nThe report sets out how aviation can keep businesses, cultures, families and nations connected without the carbon footprint. Realising this presents challenges for all facets of our aerospace and aviation sectors as well as wider industries and energy infrastructure. An integrated, collaborative, international approach to these challenges is needed to protect our planet, maintain the benefits of aviation and secure economic growth.\nIn parallel, the UK must also continue to advance technologies required for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as both SAF and liquid hydrogen are needed to achieve the net zero 2050 target.\nChris Gear, project director said: “Zero-carbon emission flight can be a reality. Tackling the challenge of our generation requires accelerated technology development and urgent investment in green energy together with regulatory and infrastructure changes.\n“The next three years are crucial to develop the technologies, build our skills in liquid hydrogen and demonstrate capability here in the UK to enable our aerospace sector and supply chain to secure its role in a new era for aviation.\n“Realising hydrogen powered flight by 2035 is a huge challenge but is essential if we are to maintain the social and economic benefits of air travel while protecting our planet and meeting our commitments to fight climate change.”\nIndustry Minister Lee Rowley said: “Realising zero carbon flight is one of the most ambitious challenges we can contemplate. However, it could also be one of the biggest economic opportunities for the UK’s world leading aerospace sector.\n“It’s great to see FlyZero’s final outputs following a year of intense research, successfully bringing UK industry together to think through how to reduce aviation’s impact on our Earth and sky while ensuring and celebrating the immense benefits of air travel and connecting the world.”.\nThe report published today summarises FlyZero’s findings in a range of key areas:\nTechnology – revolutionary technology breakthroughs are required in six areas to achieve zero-carbon emission flight: hydrogen fuel systems and tanks, hydrogen gas turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, electrical propulsion systems, aerodynamic structures and thermal management. The UK has expertise and capability today in these, but little in liquid hydrogen fuels.\nCarbon emissions – global cumulative CO2 emissions from aviation could be reduced by 4 gigatons (Gt) by 2050 and 14 Gt by 2060. This requires 50% of the commercial fleet to be hydrogen-powered by 2050 and assumes midsize hydrogen-powered aircraft are operating by 2035, with hydrogen-powered narrowbody aircraft in service by 2037.\nNon-CO2 emissions – burning hydrogen in a gas turbine emits no CO2 or SOx but water emissions are over 2.5 times higher than for fossil fuel-powered aircraft. Particulate matter will largely be eliminated, and it is estimated that NOx emissions will be reduced by 50 to 70%.\nSustainability – developing a new generation of aircraft presents an opportunity to integrate sustainability into design and manufacture, and further improve the reuse of materials.\nEconomics – from the mid-2030s liquid hydrogen will be cheaper than the most widely available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), power-to-liquid.\nMarket impact – the optimum route to decarbonising aviation is through the accelerated introduction into service of a large commercial aircraft similar to FlyZero’s midsize concept which is capable of reaching anywhere in the world with just one stop. Less commercially risky than developing a narrowbody first, this midsize first approach would also allow infrastructure development to be focused on fewer, but larger international hub airports.\nInfrastructure and operations – generating the quantity of hydrogen needed for aviation will require unprecedented renewable energy capacity. Transporting hydrogen to airports will require gaseous pipelines or liquid hydrogen tanker deliveries, while refuelling aircraft will require larger diameter hoses and increased automation to ensure it can take place safely and efficiently alongside other aircraft.\nResearch – the UK requires a hydrogen research and development facility with open access for academia and a range of industries including aerospace, automotive, marine, space and energy.\nClimate science – research into the climate impact of emissions from hydrogen gas turbines including through modelling and testing is fundamental alongside the technology development.\nThe FlyZero project is publishing its detailed conclusions through a series of reports which explore the technology challenges, manufacturing demands, operational requirements, market opportunity and sustainability credentials of zero-carbon emission commercial aircraft. A series of more detailed and technical reports together with new supporting research from industry and academia are also available to organisations that meet the requirements of an access test. For a full list of reports and information on how to access them, visit ati.org.uk/flyzero-reports.\nThe FlyZero project has made some initial conclusions that require further investigation and investment to understand the feasibility and approach to innovation for the next phase. To this end the ATI will incorporate the findings from the project into its forthcoming technology and portfolio strategies and look to pursue opportunities for the UK.\n", "中文原文": "英国对零碳排放商业航空旅行的研究FlyZero公布了新一代液氢动力飞机的愿景，今天3月17日星期四。《我们对零碳排放航空旅行的愿景》报告标志着一项为期12个月的研究的结论，该研究旨在考虑零碳排放飞机的可行性。该项目得出结论，通过发展可持续航空燃料(SAF)和绿色液氢技术，航空可以在2050年实现净零排放。为了确保新氢动力飞机的市场份额，英国公司必须准备好在2025年前展示技术。这一时间表是新零碳排放飞机到2035年服役和实现2050年净零排放目标的关键。由航空航天技术研究所(ATI)领导并得到英国政府支持的FlyZero得出结论，绿色液氢是零碳排放飞行的最佳燃料，可以为一架载有280名乘客的中型飞机提供动力，从伦敦直接飞往旧金山，或者从伦敦飞往奥克兰只需一站。到2035年推出中型氢动力飞机，到2037年推出窄体飞机，这是减少碳排放和最大限度扩大市场影响的最大机会。到2050年，航空业的碳排放将减少4千兆吨，相当于全球航空业四年的碳排放总量，如果到那时一半的商业机队是氢动力的，到2060年是14兆吨。英国可以利用几十年来在航空航天创新方面的专业知识，与全球原始设备制造商、政府和监管机构合作，推动新一代液氢动力飞机进入我们的天空。通过有针对性的技术投资，到2050年，英国在民用航天领域的市场份额可能从目前的12%增长到19%，使该行业对经济的增加值总额从110亿英镑增加到360亿英镑，航空航天就业岗位从11.6万个增加到15.4万个。该报告阐述了航空如何在没有碳足迹的情况下保持企业、文化、家庭和国家之间的联系。意识到这一点对我们航天和航空部门以及更广泛的工业和能源基础设施的各个方面都提出了挑战。为了保护我们的地球，保持航空的好处，确保经济增长，需要采取综合、协作和国际办法来应对这些挑战。与此同时，英国还必须继续推进可持续航空燃料(SAF)所需的技术，因为实现2050年净零目标需要SAF和液氢。项目主任克里斯·吉尔说：“零碳排放飞行可以成为现实。应对我们这一代人的挑战需要加速技术开发和对绿色能源的紧急投资，同时进行监管和基础设施改革。“未来三年对开发技术、培养我们在液氢方面的技能和在英国展示能力至关重要，以使我们的航空航天部门和供应链能够确保在航空新时代发挥作用。“到2035年实现氢动力飞行是一个巨大的挑战，但如果我们要在保护我们的地球和履行我们应对气候变化的承诺的同时保持航空旅行的社会和经济效益，这是至关重要的。”工业部长李·罗利说：“实现零碳飞行是我们能想到的最雄心勃勃的挑战之一。然而，这也可能是英国世界领先的航空航天行业最大的经济机遇之一。“很高兴看到FlyZero在经过一年的紧张研究后的最终成果，成功地将英国行业聚集在一起，思考如何减少航空对我们地球和天空的影响，同时确保和庆祝航空旅行的巨大好处，并连接世界。”。今天发表的报告总结了FlyZero在一系列关键领域的发现：技术--实现零碳排放飞行需要在六个领域取得革命性技术突破：氢燃料系统和贮箱、氢燃气轮机、氢燃料电池、电力推进系统、气动结构和热管理。英国今天在这些方面有专业知识和能力，但在液氢燃料方面很少。碳排放--到2050年，全球航空累计二氧化碳排放量可减少4千吨(Gt)，到2060年可减少14千吨(Gt)。这要求到2050年50%的商业机队使用氢动力，并假设到2035年中型氢动力飞机投入运营，到2037年氢动力窄体飞机投入使用。非二氧化碳排放--在燃气轮机中燃烧氢气不会排放二氧化碳或SOx，但水的排放比化石燃料飞机高2.5倍以上。颗粒物将在很大程度上被消除，预计NOx排放量将减少50%至70%。可持续发展-开发新一代飞机提供了整合可持续发展的机会", "中文源标题": "到2025年，第一代零碳排放飞机需要氢技术", "英文整编": "On the same day, the British Institute of Aerospace Technology (ATI) announced that its FlyZero project had completed its 12-month preliminary research, and released a report entitled \"Our Vision for Zero-Carbon Emission Air Travel\", which showed the vision for a new generation of liquid hydrogen-powered aircraft, which aims to explore the feasibility of zero-carbon aircraft.The FlyZero project team brings together 100 experts from Airbus, Rollo, GKN Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems, General Aviation, Reaction Engines, NATS, EasyJet and Eaton. By comparing zero-carbon emission energy sources such as batteries, hydrogen and ammonia, it is concluded that green liquid hydrogen is the most feasible and has the potential to be extended to large aircraft using fuel cells, gas turbines and hybrid propulsion systems. In order for the aviation industry to achieve the net zero goal in 2050, it is necessary to invest in the development of sustainable aviation fuels and green liquid hydrogen technology. In order to ensure the market share of new hydrogen-powered aircraft, British companies must be ready for technology demonstration before 2025, which is very important for the new zero-carbon aircraft to be put into use in 2035 and achieve the goal of net zero emissions in 2050.Introducing a medium-sized hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 and a narrow-body aircraft by 2037 is an important opportunity to reduce carbon emissions and maximize market influence. By 2050, the carbon emissions of aviation industry will be reduced by 4 billion tons, which is equivalent to the emissions of global aviation industry for 4 years. If half of commercial aircraft use hydrogen fuel by then, the emissions will be reduced by 14 billion tons by 2060. Britain can use decades of expertise in aerospace innovation to cooperate with global aviation equipment manufacturers, governments and regulators to promote the research and development and practical application of a new generation of liquid hydrogen powered aircraft. Through targeted technology investment, by 2050, the UK's market share in civil aviation will increase from 12% now to 19%, the economic value added of the industry will increase from 11 billion pounds to 36 billion pounds, and the number of aviation jobs will increase from 11. 60,000 to 15. 40,000. Technology acceleration is the key, and the industry and aviation industry can only provide one fleet update by 2050. This provides an opportunity to introduce zero-carbon aircraft in regional aircraft, narrow-body aircraft and medium-sized aircraft markets. FlyZero has modeled these concepts and determined that it is feasible to design and fly an experimental aircraft driven by hydrogen turbines across the Atlantic by 2030. The following summarizes a series of key area findings in the FlyZero project report:? Technology-Achieving zero-carbon flight requires revolutionary technological breakthroughs in the following six areas: hydrogen fuel systems and storage tanks, hydrogen gas turbines, hydrogen fuel cells, electric propulsion systems, aerodynamic structures and thermal management. In several aspects, Britain's professional ability in liquid hydrogen fuel is relatively weak at present.? Carbon emissions-By 2050, the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions of the global aviation industry will be reduced by 4 billion tons, and by 2060, it will be reduced by 14 billion tons. This requires 50% of commercial aircraft to be hydrogen-powered by 2050, and medium-sized hydrogen-powered aircraft to be put into use by 2035 and narrow-body hydrogen-powered aircraft to be put into use by 2037.? Non-CO2 emissions-Combustion of hydrogen in gas turbines does not produce CO2 or sulfur oxides, but water emissions are 2. 5% of those of fossil fuel-powered aircraft. More than 5 times. Particulate matter will be basically eliminated, and the emission of nitrogen oxides is expected to be reduced by 50 ~ 70%.? Sustainability-The development of a new generation of aircraft will pay more attention to the sustainability of design and manufacture, and further improve the reuse of materials.? Economy-From the mid-2030s, liquid hydrogen will be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the most widely used sustainable aviation fuels.? Market impact-The best way to decarbonize aviation is to accelerate the introduction of commercial aircraft (such as FlyZero's medium-sized concept aircraft), which can reach anywhere in the world in just one stop. Compared with the previous development of narrow-body aircraft, this medium-sized aircraft has less commercial risks, and can concentrate infrastructure development on a small number of larger international hub airports.? Infrastructure and operations-Producing the amount of hydrogen needed by the aviation industry will require unprecedented renewable energy capacity. Transporting hydrogen to the airport will require gas pipelines or liquid hydrogen tankers, while hydrogenation facilities will require larger diameter hoses and a higher degree of automation to ensure that it can operate safely and efficiently with other aircraft.? Research-Britain currently needs a hydrogen energy research and development institution, which is open to academia and a series of industries including aerospace, automobile, ocean, space and energy.? Climate science-study the impact of hydrogen turbine emissions on climate, and carry out a series of modeling and testing, which is also the basic content of this technology development."}, {"中文标题": "美国和以色列企业联合为美军开发微型巡飞弹", "情报来源": "荷兰航天防务新闻网站", "时间": "2022年10月7日", "整编内容": "美国莱昂纳多DRS公司近日宣布已与以色列斯皮尔无人机公司（SpearUAV）签订协议，将为美国市场开发一种微型“蝰蛇”巡飞弹（VIPER）。斯皮尔公司吸取最近重大冲突中的经验教训，迅速开发出了一款垂直发射的四旋翼巡飞弹“蝰蛇”，旨在为作战人员提供成本低廉、简单高效的弹药来打击包括遮蔽目标在内的各种目标。“蝰蛇”可为班组级部队提供有组织的、反应迅速的精确火力，使操作人员能在不依赖更高级别资源的情况下摧毁敌人狙击手和火箭推进榴弹（RPG）小组等直接威胁。此外，“蝰蛇”的精度还可以将复杂城市地形的附带伤害降至最低。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中国电科", "源网址": "https://www.asdnews.com/news/defense/2022/10/07/leonardo-drs-teams-with-spearuav-ltd-nanoscale-aerial-munitions#:~:text=Oct%207%2C%202022%20Leonardo%20DRS%20Teams%20with%20SpearUAV,VIPER%20nano-scale%20aerial%20munition%20for%20the%20US%20market.", "源标题": "Leonardo DRS Teams with SpearUAV Ltd for Nano-scale Aerial Munitions", "原文": "Leonardo DRS, Inc.

Those technologies that don’t have a big impact on the outcome will either be dropped or sent back a few steps for refinement, she said.\nShyu is also looking for asymmetric countermeasures that can offset adversary strengths, about which she didn’t elaborate.\n“Our decisions and investments ought to be driven by exquisite modeling/simulation” at the campaign level, which offers excursions on new capabilities for both the Red and Blue forces, she said.\n“We can literally play it out,” she said. “Let’s go through this battle and see what happens.”\nIf a technology plugged into the game “doesn’t really change the outcome, do I really need this? Should I spend my money somewhere else? Where I can get a bigger bang for the buck?”\nShe said this approach is being taken for a number of new capabilities among her 14 technology priorities. A specific one is looking at many variations of the nuclear command and control system.\n“This is how we get rapid experimentation capabilities proven in a contested environment,” she said. Sometimes, “a great widget works fabulously inside your lab, but when you get it out to the real environment, all the pitfalls show up.”\nThe results of these exercises, along with her office’s notes, are providing insights to help the Joint Staff and regional combatant commanders set their priorities for what they want the R&E enterprise to focus on.\nShyu declined to pick the most important or highest-priority areas under her 14 areas, saying that’s like a parent choosing a favorite child. “They’re all beautiful,” she said.\nThe 14 areas laid out in a February memo from Shyu include ”seed areas” such as biotechnology, future wireless technology, quantum science, and advanced materials. Under “effective adoption areas,” Shyu listed technologies already available in the commercial market which can be integrated into defense systems. These include artificial intelligence and autonomy, human-machine teaming, advanced computing, microelectronics, space technology, renewable energy, and energy storage.\nA third grouping identified as “defense-specific” includes hypersonics, directed-energy weapons, integrated sensing systems, and cyber warfare.\nIn her February memo listing the 14 focus areas, Shyu said she will rapidly protype systems that employ these capabilities and develop “continuous campaigns of Joint experimentation” to refine and deliver the new capabilities.\nShyu said her office will release an “unclassified volume” describing the technology foundations of the National Defense Strategy, “so the public has visibility into these technology areas that are priorities.” Industry may also be able to see a classified version “to give you a little more context about why” certain technologies are priorities and others aren’t, she said. It will contain “a rationale you won’t see in the unclassified” version.\nShyu said she’s anxious to “transition” new technologies into the hands of operators. But “everyone has a different definition of ‘transition,’” she said. The obvious one is when an “advanced prototype” turns into a program of record, but “it could be a piece of software that got into the hands of a warfighter … It could be something dual-use, and we decide to go commercial. That’s a successful transition: We funded it; it went commercial; we’re buying it off the shelf.”\nShyu also said she is making more efficient use of technology funds. New data systems are giving her insight into the technology programs across the breadth of the Pentagon’s science and technology and R&D enterprise at a level of detail not previously available, “and we’re sharing that with industry.” She said she has monthly meetings with small and large companies, looking for feedback on the “pain points” of working the Pentagon S&T enterprise.\nHer shop is also focusing on international engagements, sharing information that can help avoid duplication of effort and yield results that both parties can use. As an example, she cited the SCIFIRE air-breathing hypersonics initiative with Australia, which she said helped the Air Force makes its downselect for the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile.\n“Every single novel idea was not invented here, right?” Shyu said, adding that she wants to “look wide” at partner and ally technologies, in an application of “integrated deterrence,” to “collaborate together to counter our adversary.” She said she’s created a “SAP umbrella”—meaning special access programs information sharing agreement—“to share more sensitive information” in pursuit of co-development.\nShe noted that President Biden “made the decision to share exquisite [intelligence] data with NATO. That built trust. Because they realized” what the U.S. said it was seeing “all … came true,” and that built trust to work better together.\n“I want to share development with partner nations,” she asserted, naming “Australia, the UK, NATO, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Latvia … Israel, you name it” who “all want to be partners with us, [who are] interested in co-development.”\nShe’s particularly interested in “leap ahead” technologies that can asymmetrically blunt certain threats, which will be important for the “campaigning” aspect of the NDS’s integrated deterrence mantra, Shyu said.\n“Just because you have 1,000 tanks, if I have 1,001, I win … that’s very linear thinking. I want to think about what are the asymmetric ways we can counter the threat,” she said.\nTo that end, she’s setting up a “war room” that will focus all available “intel threat” intelligence, along with the state-of-the-art of technology and the status of technology efforts underway in the DOD, so that “we can get to … the asymmetric things we’re developing, faster.”\n“So that the ‘war room,’ and I want to use that to drive the S&T strategy,” she said. It will look at the enterprise “cohesively. And it’s going to cover underwater to space.”\nShyu said she’s had “a very significant impact on the POM,” or five-year spending plan, and that’s because she has regular engagement with the regional commanders and understand their needs for “what we need to be ready in the 10-20-30 year timeframe” as well as in the short term.\nThe acquisition system needs to move faster, Shyu said, and have more flexibility. China, she said, doesn’t suffer from the protracted process of funding requests, approvals, and oversight, and this allows them to obtain new technology faster.\n“Our budget process is a two-year process … and you have to have exquisite knowledge of what you need … five years into the future,” Shyu said, which is “crazy because threats may pop up that you didn’t anticipate.”\n“Right now, we have a problem: You did [research, development, test and evaluation]. Now, did you POM [submit a long-term plan] for the procurement money? If you didn’t … then it’s a year you’re sitting there waiting for the procurement money.”\nShyu asked, “Why would you do things like this to yourself? Right? Money is money.”\nShe said the Pentagon needs “a lot more flexibility to be able to pivot. It’s a rigid structure to which we shackle ourselves, like tying our shoelaces together and trying to run.” It would be a big help to “give us some colorless money, as well,” she said, referring to funding accounts that can only be used for certain kinds of technology efforts, often referred to as the “color of money” problem.\nAsked about friction in the breakup of the position of undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics into two jobs—hers, and that of theUSD for acquisition and sustainment, William A. LaPlante—Shyu said the friction is largely erased because of their working relationship.\nWhen Shyu was acquisition executive for the Army, LaPlante was the acquisition executive for the Air Force, and they have a solid partnership, she said.\nIf there’s a problem between the two enterprises, “it gets escalated up to us … and we fix it in five minutes. We trust each other,” she said. This “sets the example” for the two organizations to be collaborative, she said.\n", "中文原文": "2022年11月8日，约翰·蒂尔帕克负责研究和工程的国防部副部长Heidi Shu说，战争游戏的结果和不对称对抗对手的机会正在推动五角大楼对新技术的投资选择。她还表示，一份概述支撑新国防战略的科学和技术的非机密文件将于春季公布。在11月3日由乔治·梅森大学主办的一次以收购为主题的活动中，Shu说，她选择投资一些技术，这些技术被证明对大型战争游戏的结果产生了重大影响，这些战争游戏源于国防高级研究计划局（Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency）开发的游戏系统。她说，那些对结果没有太大影响的技术要么被放弃，要么被退回几步进行改进。Shyu还在寻找可以抵消对手优势的非对称对策，对此她没有详细说明。她说，“我们的决定和投资应该由精巧的建模/仿真驱动”，这为红蓝部队提供了新能力的考察。“我们真的可以把它发挥出来，”她说。“让我们经历这场战斗，看看会发生什么。”如果插入游戏的技术“并没有真正改变结果，我真的需要这个吗？我应该把钱花在别的地方吗？在哪里我可以用钱得到更大的爆炸？“她说，在她的14项技术优先事项中，许多新功能正在采取这种方法。一个具体的研究是核指挥和控制系统的许多变化。“这就是我们如何在有争议的环境中获得快速实验能力的证明，”她说。有时，“一个很棒的小部件在你的实验室里工作得非常好，但是当你把它放到真实的环境中时，所有的陷阱都显现出来了。”这些演习的结果，以及她的办公室的说明，提供了深刻的见解，以帮助联合参谋部和地区战斗指挥官确定他们希望R&E企业关注的优先事项。Shyu拒绝在她的14个领域中选择最重要或最优先的领域，她说这就像父母选择最喜欢的孩子一样。“它们都很漂亮，”她说。Shyu在2月份的备忘录中列出的14个领域包括“种子领域”，如生物技术、未来无线技术、量子科学和先进材料。在“有效采用领域”下，Shyu列出了商业市场上已经可以集成到防御系统中的技术。其中包括人工智能和自主、人机协同、先进计算、微电子、空间技术、可再生能源和能源存储。第三类被确定为“防御专用”包括高超音速、定向能武器、综合传感系统和网络战。在2月份列出14个重点领域的备忘录中，Shu表示，她将迅速开发使用这些功能的系统，并开发“持续的联合实验活动”，以完善和交付新功能。Shyu说，她的办公室将发布一份“非机密卷”，描述国防战略的技术基础，“这样公众就可以看到这些优先考虑的技术领域。”她说，工业界也可以看到一个机密版本，“让你更多地了解为什么”某些技术是优先考虑的，而其他技术不是优先考虑的“。它将包含“一个你不会在非机密版本中看到的理由”版本。Shyu说，她急于将新技术“转移”到运营商手中。但是“每个人对‘过渡’都有不同的定义，”她说。显而易见的是，当一个“先进的原型”变成一个记录程序时，但“它可能是一个落入战斗机手中的软件……它可能是两用的东西，我们决定商业化。这是一个成功的过渡：我们资助了它；它变成了商业；我们从架子上买。“Shyu还说，她正在更有效地利用技术资金。新的数据系统让她以以前没有的细节水平洞察了五角大楼科技和研发企业的技术项目，“我们正在与工业界分享这一点。”她说，她每月与大小公司举行会议，寻求对五角大楼科技企业工作“痛点”的反馈。她的商店还专注于国际合作，分享有助于避免重复工作和产生双方都可以使用的结果的信息。作为一个例子，她引用了与澳大利亚的SCIFIRE吸气高超音速倡议，她说该倡议帮助空军为高超音速攻击巡航导弹做出了下选择。“每一个新的想法都不是在这里发明的，对吗？”Shyu说，并补充说，她希望在“integr”的应用程序中“广泛观察”合作伙伴和盟友的技术", "中文源标题": "Shyu说战争游戏定义了研发投资；新的NDS技术文档即将发布", "英文整编": "On November 3rd, Xu Ruobing, Deputy Secretary of Research and Engineering of the US Department of Defense, said at the acquisition meeting that the results of war chess deduction and asymmetric advantages are promoting the investment choice of the Ministry of Defense in new technologies.

Jim Dickinson.\n“Those are things that we’re looking at right now,” he told the Mitchell Institute in an online talk today.\nSPACECOM on Nov. 15 announced it had created a new headquarters structure, called theCombined Joint Task Force-Space Operations (CJTF-SO), to oversee those two commands responsible for day-to-day operations: theJoint Task Force-Space Defense(JTF-SD) and theCombined Force Space Component Command (CFSCC).\nThe JTF-SD, headquartered at Schriever SFB, Colo., is responsible for protecting and defending US space assets, including those belonging to the Intelligence Community via the bilateralNational Space Defense Center. The CFSCC, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Ca., takes care of space support functions for military operators, such as managing access to communications satellites and operating the GPS constellation. It is called a “combined force” command because it includes allied representatives.\nThe establishment of the CJTF-SO headquarters structure, Dickinson explained, was aimed at providing more “agility” and “flexibility” in decision-making than the old structure, which saw the leaders of both sub-commands reporting directly to him and SPACECOM headquarters staff.\nThe reorganization also means SPACECOM “will be able to synchronize both what we do from a space-enabling perspective as well as what we do for protect and defend on orbit,” and to avoid potential overlaps between those two inter-related missions, he said.\n“And so the purpose of CJTF-SO, as most higher headquarters, will be the synchronization of those missions and synchronization of those resources,” Dickinson said.\nAs a first step, he said, the new CJTF-SO headquarters staff is working now to establish “its functions and roles and missions,” leading up to a SPACECOM declaration of initial operational capability (IOC).\nBut Dickinson suggested SPACECOM wanted to see if it could go further to streamline that decision-making structure, by looking at “whether or not we need two command centers, whether they could be one — I mean, those are all options that we’re looking at right now,” he added.\nA SPACECOM spokesperson later in the day clarified that Dickinson was talking about two of the handful of operations centers that ultimately report up to him, rather than to overarching subordinate commands.\n“Gen. Dickinson was referencing a number of options the command is considering to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. When asked directly about any potential further consolidation, his response was referring to two of the operational centers within the command, not the operational commands themselves, as one of many options,” the spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense.\nDickinson also praised the Space Force’sNov. 23 standupof a new service component command at US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii.\n“I believe that’s the right place at the right time for that element to stand up,” he said.\nIn response to questions about how the INDOPACOM Space Force component — and by implication future planned service components at other combatant commands — will work with SPACECOM’s own regionally embeddedJoint Integrated Space Teams, Dickinson expressed no concerns about possible crossed wires.\nThe Space Force is a military service with the mission to organize, train and equip forces for operational combatant commands, of which SPACECOM is one. SPACECOM, which is both a geographical and a functional command, is responsible for ensuring other combatant commands are being provided necessary space capabilities to do their warfighting jobs, and that SPACECOM operators are responding to theater needs.\nFor example, Dickinson waived away the specter that the Space Force component might inject an additional layer of decision-making bureaucracy into the process for providing space capabilities to warfighters in the field.\n“There won’t be an additional layer,” he said. The Space Force component’s creation “is actually enhancing the relationship, if you will, between INDOPACOM and US Space Command,” he said.\nDickinson explained that all the other services have component commands at INDOPACOM — just as they do at all six other geographic combatant commands — and that the Space Force’s component will work in the same traditional way.\n“So, the INDOPACOM commander will look to that … space service component for all things space, if you will, in terms of support of his operations in his respective AOR [area of operations],” he said. “What will happen at that point will be the normal integration and coordination that would happen — that has happened [and] is happening right now — between that component and US Space Command in terms of making sure that we provide the space enabling capabilities that the INDOPACOM commander needs in support of his operations.”\nThe Guardians making up the service component command “work directly for the INDOPACOM commander, but there is a coordination relationship that already exists” with SPACECOM via the CFSCC, Dickinson added.\nThe CFSCC “executes tactical control over globally dispersed Air Force, Army, and Navy space [and now Space Force] units that command ground-based space capabilities and satellites in every orbital regime,” SPACECOM’swebsiteexplains.\nIn fact, Dickinson elaborated, Space Force created the new component by assigning to it Guardians already at INDOPACOM and familiar with the coordination process.\n“So, that relationship already exists and will continue to exist,” he said, and “will mature.”\n", "中文原文": "特里萨·希钦森2022年11月29日下午2:28华盛顿--据太空司令部司令吉姆·迪金森将军称，一旦刚刚宣布的重组到位，美国太空司令部已经在考虑进一步精简，包括合并其两个作战中心。“这些都是我们现在正在关注的事情，”他在今天的一次在线演讲中告诉米切尔研究所。11月15日，太空司令部宣布建立了一个新的总部结构，称为联合特遣部队-太空作战(CJTF-SO)，以监督负责日常行动的两个司令部：联合特遣部队-太空防御（JTF-SD）和联合部队太空组成司令部(CFSCC)。总部设在科罗拉多州施里弗SFB的JTF-SD负责保护和保卫美国太空资产，包括通过双边国家太空防御中心属于情报界的资产。总部设在加利福尼亚州范登堡SFB的CFSCC负责军事运营商的空间支持功能，如管理通信卫星的访问和操作GPS星座。它被称为“联合部队”司令部，因为它包括盟军代表。迪金森解释说，CJTF-SO总部结构的建立旨在提供比旧结构更多的决策“敏捷性”和“灵活性”，旧结构中两个子指挥部的领导人直接向他和太空司令部的工作人员报告。他说，重组还意味着SPACECOM“将能够从空间赋能的角度同步我们的工作，以及我们在轨道上保护和防御的工作”，并避免这两个相互关联的任务之间的潜在重叠。迪金森说：“因此，CJTF的目的--作为最高级的总部，将是这些任务和资源的同步。”他说，作为第一步，新的CJTF-SO总部工作人员现在正在努力建立“它的职能、作用和任务”，最终宣布初始操作能力(IOC)。但迪金森建议SPACECOM希望看看是否可以进一步简化决策结构，看看“我们是否需要两个指挥中心，它们是否可以是一个--我的意思是，这些都是我们现在正在考虑的选择，”他补充说。SPACECOM的一名发言人当天晚些时候澄清说，迪金森谈论的是最终向他报告的少数几个作战中心中的两个，而不是向最高的下级司令部报告。“将军。迪金森提到了司令部正在考虑的一些选项，以确保效率和效力。当被直接问及任何潜在的进一步整合时，他的回应是指司令部内的两个作战中心，而不是作战司令部本身，作为许多选择之一，“这位发言人在给打破防御的电子邮件中说。迪金森还赞扬了太空部队的11月23站在夏威夷美国印度-太平洋司令部总部的一个新的服务组成司令部。“我相信这是在正确的时间、正确的地点，让这种元素站起来，”他说。在回答关于INDOPACOM太空部队部分--以及暗示其他作战司令部未来计划的服务部分--将如何与SPACECOM自己的区域嵌入联合综合太空小组合作的问题时，迪金森对可能的交叉电线表示不担心。太空部队是一个兵种，其任务是为作战指挥组织、训练和装备部队，太空司令部就是其中之一。太空司令部既是地理司令部，也是职能司令部，它负责确保其他作战司令部获得必要的太空能力来完成作战任务，并确保太空司令部操作员对战区需求做出反应。例如，迪金森放弃了太空部队部门可能会在向战场上的战斗人员提供太空能力的过程中注入额外的决策层官僚机构的恐惧。“不会有额外的一层，”他说。他说，太空部队组成部分的创建“实际上是在加强INDOPACOM和美国太空司令部之间的关系，如果你愿意的话”。迪金森解释说，所有其他军种在INDOPACOM都有组成司令部--就像他们在所有其他六个地理作战司令部一样--太空部队的组成司令部将以同样的传统方式工作。他说：“因此，INDOPACOM指挥官将在支持他在各自的AOR（行动区）的行动方面，为太空的所有事情寻求……太空服务部门。”“届时将会发生的是该组成部分和美国太空司令部之间将会发生的正常整合和协调--已经发生和正在发生--以确保我们提供太空支持", "中文源标题": "太空探索进一步完善指挥链", "英文整编": "Jim Dickinson, commander of the US Space Command, said that the Space Command will continue to integrate, streamline and optimize the space command chain.

As the geographical and functional command, the Indo-Pacific Regional Space Command will ensure that other departments obtain the space combat capability needed to complete combat missions."}, {"中文标题": "朝鲜或在2023年进行核试验", "情报来源": "俄罗斯塔斯社网站", "时间": "2023年1月30日", "整编内容": "俄罗斯国际事务委员会总干事科尔图诺夫2023年1月30日表示，朝鲜可能在2023年进行核试验，美国或韩国更严厉的言辞不会阻止朝鲜领导人的决定。在分析当前朝鲜半岛的紧张局势时，这位专家提醒人们注意韩国总统尹锡悦2023年1月初发表的声明。该声明称，如果朝鲜核计划导致朝鲜半岛局势恶化，韩国可能会从另一个国家获得核武器，或者制造自己的核武器。该声明是在北约秘书长斯托尔滕贝格访问韩国和日本前夕发表的。朝鲜国际政策科学学会的一名工作人员称，这是亚太地区“对抗和战争的前奏”。科尔图诺夫认为，在这种背景下，不排除为了报复，朝鲜在2023年进行核试验。朝鲜宪法对核武器的地位有明确规定。无论如何，朝鲜都不会放弃核武器。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中核战略规划研究总院", "源网址": "https://tass.com/defense/1569053", "源标题": "Pyongyang may stage nuclear test in 2023 — Russian expert", "原文": "30 JAN, 23:33\nAndrey Kortunov noted that South Korea and the United States’ harsher rhetoric will not work as a deterrent, while China does enjoy certain political influence on Pyongyang\nPyongyang\n? Alexandr Demyanchuk/TASS\nMOSCOW, January 30. /TASS/. Pyongyang may conduct a nuclear test in 2023, thus such a development should not be ruled out, the general director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrey Kortunov, told TASS on Monday.\nHe is certain that harsher rhetoric by the United States or South Korea will do nothing to deter the DPRK’s leadership.\nWhile analyzing the current tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the expert drew attention to South Korean President Yoon Sok-yeol’s statement in early January that South Korea might host nuclear weapons of another state or create its own, should the situation on the peninsula get worse due to North Korea’s nuclear program. Yoon’s statement came on the eve of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg’s visits to Seoul and Tokyo, which a staffer of the DPRK’s International Policy Science Society, Kim Dong Myung, has already dubbed \"a prelude to confrontation and war\" in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR). Kortunov believes that against this background, it should not be ruled out that in its attempts to retaliate, Pyongyang may go as far as staging a nuclear test in 2023.\n\"We cannot write off this possibility,\" he stressed. \"Ballistic missile tests are already underway. Some very belligerent statements are being made by the North Korean leadership. Nuclear tests cannot be excluded. In any case, the DPRK, of course, will not give up nuclear weapons. This status is spelled out in the country’s Constitution.\"\nAt the same time, Kortunov noted that South Korea and the United States’ harsher rhetoric will not work as a deterrent, while China does enjoy certain political influence on Pyongyang. \"If Pyongyang shows restraint, it will do so not because of some statements by South Korea or the United States, or Japan. It may turn an attentive ear to China, since North Korean tests, to be carried out in the north, not far from the Chinese border, naturally, cause concern not only in the capitals of the DPRK’s geopolitical opponents, but also in Beijing and in Moscow,\" he continued.\nThe expert pointed out that amid mutual distrust in the region one should expect wider bilateral cooperation between South Korea and the United States and between South Korea and Japan. Overall tensions in the Asia-Pacific Region may soar. \"A variety of scenarios is possible,\" Kortunov noted. \"For one, the situation may aggravate along the demarcation line between North Korea and South Korea.

SITUATION. I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] secured his third term and set his war council in October 2022. Taiwan’s presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a reason. United States’ presidential elections are in 2024 and will offer Xi a distracted America. Xi’s team, reason, and opportunity are all aligned for 2025. We spent 2022 setting the foundation for victory. We will spend 2023 in crisp operational motion building on that foundation. If you want to know what the operational motion I demand looks like, look at what Total Force Team Charleston did in January.\n2. COMMANDER’S INTENT. Go faster. Drive readiness, integration, and agility for ourselves and the Joint Force to deter, and if required, defeat China. This is the first of 8 monthly directives from me. You need to know I alone own the pen on these orders. My expectations are high, and these orders are not up for negotiation. Follow them. I will be tough, fair, and loving in my approach to secure victory.\n3. END STATE. A fortified, ready, integrated, and agile Joint Force Maneuver Team ready to fight and win inside the first island chain. Maximize the use of the force and the tools we currently have and extract full value from things that currently exist. Close the gaps: C2, navigation, maneuver under attack, and tempo.\n4. RISK. Run deliberately, not recklessly. You will be governed by the principle of calculated training risk, which you shall interpret to mean the avoidance of death, serious injury, and Class A damage to attain higher readiness, integration, and agility. If the Tactic, Technique, and Procedure you are developing increases AMC’s ability to fight and win inside the first island chain… move out. If you are comfortable in your approach to training, then you are not taking enough risk.\n5. OT&E. Attached are our OT&E efforts from 2022 Fall PHOENIX Rally, which will guide our preparation but are not intended to limit creativity of approach. This is not an all-encompassing list. I expect you to move out briskly on the monthly tasks, anticipate the projected tasks and weave them eloquently into your units’ training and operational battle rhythms.\n6. FEBRUARY. (a) All AMC aligned personnel with weapons qualifications will fire a clip into a 7-meter target with the full understanding that unrepentant lethality matters most. Aim for the head. (b) All AMC personnel will update vRED [virtual Record of Emergency Data]. (c) All commanders will acknowledge this order directly to me immediately. Then, report all 2022 accomplishments preparing for the China fight, and forecast major efforts in 2023 through command chains by COB 28 February 2023.\n7. MARCH (Projected). (a) All units will report progress toward established OT&E requirements for INDOPACOM Operations discussed and reviewed at Fall PHOENIX Rally. (b) All AMC personnel will consider their personal affairs and whether a visit should be scheduled with their servicing base legal office to ensure they are legally ready and prepared. (c) KC-135 units will coordinate to provide a conceptual means of air delivering 100 off-the-shelf size and type UAVs from a single aircraft.\n8. APRIL (Projected).

The Russian Kornet anti-tank missile system is capable of piercing any smart active protection system of armor with a paired launch of missiles, Editor-in-Chief of Independent Military Review Dmitry Litovkin told TASS on Wednesday.\n\"It was pointed out that the Kornet self-propelled anti-tank missile systems can fire in tandem mode, specifically, two missiles can be launched at a time within a single command and control field to pierce the enemy armor’s active protection system.

This research area, known as integrated photonics, is fast evolving and investigators are now exploring the shorter—visible—wavelength range to develop a broad variety of emerging applications. These include chip-scale LIDAR (light detection and ranging), AR/VR/MR (augmented/virtual/mixed reality) goggles, holographic displays, quantum information processing chips, and implantable optogenetic probes in the brain.\nThe one device critical to all these applications in the visible range is an optical phase modulator, which controls the phase of a light wave, similar to how the phase of radio waves is modulated in wireless computer networks. With a phase modulator, researchers can build an on-chip optical switch that channels light into different waveguide ports. With a large network of these optical switches, researchers could create sophisticated integrated optical systems that could control light propagating on a tiny chip or light emission from the chip.\nBut phase modulators in the visible range are very hard to make: there are no materials that are transparent enough in the visible spectrum while also providing large tunability, either through thermo-optical or electro-optical effects. Currently, the two most suitable materials are silicon nitride and lithium niobate. While both are highly transparent in the visible range, neither one provides very much tunability. Visible-spectrum phase modulators based on these materials are thus not only large but also power-hungry: the length of individual waveguide-based modulators ranges from hundreds of microns to several mm and a single modulator consumes tens of mW for phase tuning. Researchers trying to achieve large-scale integration—embedding thousands of devices on a single microchip—have, up to now, been stymied by these bulky, energy-consuming devices.\nToday, Columbia Engineering researchers announced that they have found a solution to this problem—they've developed a way based on micro-ring resonators to dramatically reduce both the size and the power consumption of a visible-spectrum phase modulator, from 1 mm to 10 microns and from tens of mW for π phase tuning to below 1 mW. The study was published today by Nature Photonics.\n\"Usually the bigger something is, the better. But integrated devices are a notable exception,\" said Nanfang Yu, associate professor of applied physics, co-principal investigator (PI) on the team, and an expert in nanophotonics. \"It's really hard to confine light to a spot and manipulate it without losing much of its power. We are excited that in this work we've made a breakthrough that will greatly expand the horizon of large-scale visible-spectrum integrated photonics.\"\nConventional optical phase modulators operating at visible wavelengths are based on light propagation in waveguides. Yu worked with his colleague Michal Lipson, who is the leading expert on integrated photonics based on silicon nitride, to develop a very different approach.\n\"The key to our solution was to use an optical resonator and to operate it in the so-called strongly over-coupled regime,\" said Lipson, co-PI on the team and Eugene Higgins Professor of Electrical Engineering and professor of applied physics.\nOptical resonators are structures with a high degree of symmetry, such as rings that can cycle a beam of light many times and translate tiny refractive index changes to a large phase modulation. Resonators can operate under several different conditions and so need to be used carefully. For example, if operating in the \"under coupled\" or \"critical coupled\" regimes, a resonator will only provide a limited phase modulation and, more problematically, introduce a large amplitude variation to the optical signal. The latter is a highly undesirable optical loss because accumulation of even moderate losses from individual phase modulators will prevent cascading them to form a circuit that has a sufficiently large output signal.\nTo achieve a complete 2π phase tuning and minimal amplitude variation, the Yu-Lipson team chose to operate a micro-ring in the \"strongly over-coupled\" regime, a condition where the coupling strength between the micro-ring and the \"bus\" waveguide that feeds light into the ring is at least 10 times stronger than the loss of the micro-ring. \"The latter is primarily due to optical scattering at the nanoscale roughness on the device sidewalls,\" Lipson explained. \"You can never fabricate photonic devices with perfectly smooth surfaces.\"\nThe team developed several strategies to push the devices into the strongly over-coupled regime. The most crucial one was their invention of an adiabatic micro-ring geometry, where the ring smoothly transitions between a narrow neck and a wide belly, which are at the opposite edges of the ring. The narrow neck of the ring facilitates the exchange of light between the bus waveguide and the micro-ring, thus enhancing the coupling strength. The ring's wide belly reduces optical loss because the guided light interacts only with the outer sidewall, not the inner sidewall, of the widened portion of the adiabatic micro-ring, substantially reducing optical scattering at the sidewall roughness.\nIn a comparative study of adiabatic micro-rings and conventional micro-rings with uniform width fabricated side by side on the same chip, the team found that none of the conventional micro-rings satisfied the strong over-coupling condition—in fact, they suffered very bad optical losses—while 63% of the adiabatic micro-rings kept operating in the strongly over-coupled regime.\n\"Our best phase modulators operating at the blue and green colors, which are the most difficult portion of the visible spectrum, have a radius of only 5 microns, consume power of 0.8 mW for π phase tuning, and introduce an amplitude variation of less than 10%,\" said Heqing Huang, a graduate student in Yu's lab and first author of the paper. \"No prior work has demonstrated such compact, power-efficient, and low-loss phase modulators at visible wavelengths.\"\nThe devices were designed in Yu's lab and fabricated in the Columbia Nano Initiative cleanroom, at the Advanced Science Research Center NanoFabrication Facility at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. Device characterization was conducted in Lipson's and Yu's labs.\nThe researchers note that while they are nowhere near the degree of integration of electronics, their work shrinks the gap between photonic and electronic switches substantially. \"If previous modulator technologies only allow for integration of 100 waveguide phase modulators given a certain chip footprint and power budget, now we can do that 100 times better and integrate 10,000 phase shifters on chip to realize much more sophisticated functions,\" said Yu.\nThe Lipson and Yu labs are now collaborating to demonstrate visible-spectrum LIDAR consisting of large 2D arrays of phase shifters based on adiabatic micro-rings. The design strategies employed for their visible-spectrum thermo-optical devices can be applied to electro-optical modulators to reduce their footprints and drive voltages, and can be adapted in other spectral ranges (e.g., ultraviolet, telecom, mid-infrared, and THz) and in other resonator designs beyond micro-rings.\n\"Thus, our work can inspire future effort where people can implement strong over-coupling in a wide range of resonator-based devices to enhance light-matter interactions, for example, for enhancing optical nonlinearity, for making novel lasers, for observing novel quantum optical effects, while suppressing optical losses at the same time,\" Lipson said.\n", "中文原文": "在过去的几十年里，研究人员已经从使用电流转向在近红外范围内操纵光波，用于电信应用，如高速5G网络、芯片上的生物传感器和无人驾驶汽车。这个被称为集成光子学的研究领域正在迅速发展，研究人员正在探索更短的可见波长范围，以开发各种各样的新兴应用。其中包括芯片级激光雷达（光探测和测距）、AR/VR/MR（增强/虚拟/混合现实）护目镜、全息显示器、量子信息处理芯片，以及大脑中可植入的光基因探针。在可见光范围内，对所有这些应用至关重要的一个设备是光学相位调制器，它控制光波的相位，类似于无线计算机网络中无线电波的相位调制。利用相位调制器，研究人员可以构建一个片上光开关，将光引导到不同的波导端口。有了这些光开关的大型网络，研究人员可以创建复杂的集成光学系统，可以控制光在微小芯片上传播或芯片上的光发射。但是在可见光范围内的相位调制器很难制作：没有一种材料可以通过热光或电光效应在可见光光谱中足够透明，同时提供大的可调谐性。目前最合适的两种材料是氮化硅和铌酸锂。虽然两者在可见范围内都是高度透明的，但都没有提供太多的可调性。因此，基于这些材料的可见光谱相位调制器不仅体积大，而且耗电巨大：单个波导调制器的长度从数百微米到几毫米不等，单个调制器用于相位调谐需要几十毫瓦。研究人员试图实现大规模集成--在单个微芯片上嵌入数千个设备--迄今为止，一直被这些笨重、耗能的设备所阻碍。今天，哥伦比亚大学工程研究人员宣布，他们已经找到了解决这个问题的方法--他们开发了一种基于微环谐振器的方法，可以大幅降低可见光谱相位调制器的尺寸和功耗，从1毫米降低到10微米，从π相位调谐的几十毫瓦降低到1毫瓦以下。这项研究发表在今天的《自然·光子学》杂志上。“通常东西越大越好。但集成器件是一个明显的例外，”应用物理学副教授、该团队的联合首席研究员(PI)和纳米光子学专家南方·余说。“将光限制在一个点上并在不损失大部分功率的情况下操纵它真的很难。我们感到兴奋的是，在这项工作中，我们取得了突破，将大大拓展大规模可见光谱集成光子学的视野。”在可见光波段工作的传统光学相位调制器是基于光在波导中的传播。Yu与他的同事Michal Lipson合作，开发了一种非常不同的方法。Michal Lipson是基于氮化硅的集成光子学方面的领先专家。“我们解决方案的关键是使用光学谐振器，并在所谓的强过耦合状态下操作它，”该团队的合作伙伴、尤金·希金斯电气工程教授和应用物理学教授利普森说。光学谐振腔是一种具有高度对称性的结构，例如可以将一束光循环多次并将微小的折射率变化转化为大的相位调制的环。谐振器可以在几种不同的条件下工作，因此需要小心使用。例如，如果在“欠耦合”或“临界耦合”状态下工作，谐振器将只提供有限的相位调制，并且更有问题的是，将较大的振幅变化引入光信号。后者是非常不希望的光损耗，因为来自单个相位调制器的即使中等损耗的积累也将阻止它们级联以形成具有足够大输出信号的电路。为了实现完整的2π相位调谐和最小的振幅变化，Yu-Lipson团队选择在“强过耦合”状态下操作微环，在这种状态下，微环与向环中输入光的“总线”波导之间的耦合强度至少比微环的损耗强10倍。“后者主要是由于器件侧壁上纳米级粗糙度的光学散射，”Lipson解释说。“你永远无法制造出表面完美光滑的光子器件。”该团队开发了几种策略来推动设备进入强烈的过度耦合状态。最关键的一个是他们发明了绝热微环几何结构，环在窄脖子和宽肚子之间平稳地过渡，这两者是对立的", "中文源标题": "一种新的器件可以以最小的占地面积和最低的功耗调制可见光而不使其变暗", "英文整编": "Recently, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences of Columbia University has developed a new method based on micro-ring resonator, which is expected to greatly reduce the size and power consumption of visible spectrum phase modulator from 1 mm to 10 microns, and the power consumption of π phase tuning from tens of milliwatts to below 1 milliwatt, providing a new technical scheme for the research and development of phase modulator.

In order to better make the equipment enter a strong over-coupling state, researchers invented an adiabatic micro-ring geometry to enhance the coupling strength and reduce the optical scattering at the roughness of the sidewall. This research provides a new technical support for the research and development of new phase modulators."}, {"中文标题": "美国测试最新升级的“爱国者”防空导弹系统", "情报来源": "军事透露网", "时间": "2022年8月25日", "整编内容": "美国已开始对“爱国者”防空导弹系统最新升级型进行为期一年的测试。此次升级是2018年以来的最新的一次升级。从2022年6月初开始，美国陆军作战试验司令部防空反导试验局与第30防空炮兵旅第6防空炮兵测试分队第3营和多个政府机构一起测试升级后的系统。除了软件和硬件升级外，系统的用户界面也更为友好，可提高士兵的训练效率。升级后的“爱国者”防空导弹系统将至少服役到2040年。美国陆军作战试验司令部位于德克萨斯州胡德堡，是美国陆军唯一的独立作战试验机构，其防空反导试验局负责规划和执行防空反导相关项目的独立作战试验。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "北方科技信息研究所", "源网址": "https://militaryleak.com/2022/08/25/us-army-air-defenders-test-newest-patriot-missile-system-upgrades/", "源标题": "MilitaryLeak", "原文": "Breaking Military News And Defense Technology.\nSearch for:\nclose\nUS Army Air Defenders Test Newest Patriot Missile System Upgrades\nUS Army Air Defenders Test Newest Patriot Missile System Upgrades\nAugust 25, 2022byAdmin\nSixty-five Soldiers and 135 Government Civilians started a yearlong test on the latest Patriot Missile System upgrade.

Future increments of PrSM, the upcoming replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System, are expected to feature an anti-ship seeker, increased lethality and extended range. But the Army has not previously said that the extra range would come from a ramjet. Senior Army acquisition and modernization officials disclosed the ramjet plans and previous testing in testimony submitted for a Senate Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee hearing today. “We successfully tested the Land Based Anti-Ship Missile seeker and Extended Range Propulsion ramjet, setting conditions for subsequent increments of the PrSM program,” the written testimony states. A ramjet is a form of air-breathing engine that relies upon high-velocity forward motion to compress air. Unlike a traditional jet engine, a ramjet doesn't require a fan to compress air. Compared to more traditional missiles, which carry oxidizers with their fuel, ramjets would provide greater range at less weight, Al Shoffner, a retired Army two-star general and a former director of the Fires Center of Excellence, told Inside Defense. “The advantage it has over a conventional rocket or missile is that it doesn’t have to carry as much fuel because it’s mixed with oxygen as it travels,” Shoffner said. “That allows a few things: One, reduction in weight, which is really critical, and then more room for other things that you would require payload for, such as a guidance system and the warhead.” The Army has not fielded a system with a ramjet before, he said. They have been a topic of study “for a long time,” and the technology has improved in recent years. “I think we’re to the point where we’re more confident that this will actually work, and that it can be demonstrated,” Shoffner said. Army applied research budget documents detail plans to develop an “air-breathing propulsion subsystem,” which is likely the ramjet program, for a future PrSM variant. The Army “will complete flight weight combined cycle air-breathing propulsion subsystem design and begin fabrication and integration for follow-on experiments and assessments” in fiscal year 2023, according to the budget documents. The budget request includes $8.8 million for that line of effort. Experiments in FY-22 will explore the ability of the same “air-breathing propulsion subsystem” to increase missile range “in the same form factor as traditional solid propellant rocket motor subsystems,” according to the budget documents. These science and technology developments will inform the range requirements for the future extended-range PrSM increment, the director of the Army’s Long-Range Precision Fires Cross-Functional Team told Inside Defense in October. PrSM has become one of the lead programs in the Army’s long-range fires modernization priority, which it expects will be necessary for future large-scale combat. The missile is compatible with existing rocket launchers, and two PrSMs can fit in the same rocket pod that holds a single ATACMS. An initial increment of PrSM is on schedule to be fielded at the end of FY-23 under an urgent materiel release, according to Army budget documents. That base missile will have a range of at least 500 kilometers, although the exact capability is currently unknown. Telemetry data stopped at 499 km in an October maximum-distance test, but the missile flew farther, according to the former chief of Army Futures Command. Initial operational testing on the base PrSM is planned for the first quarter of FY-25, and the missile could reach initial operational capability by the fourth quarter of that year. A demonstration of PrSM Increment 2, with the ship-hunting seeker, could take place at the beginning of FY-27, and that variant of the missile could be fielded by the end of FY-27. Increments 3 and 4, with increased lethality and extended range, would follow. The Army has funded research into ramjets that could extend the range of cannon artillery. A round would be shot out of a cannon using traditional artillery propellants, and the ramjet could turn on once the round reaches high enough speeds. A ramjet-powered missile would still require traditional missile propulsion, so that it can reach the speeds necessary for the ramjet to work, Shoffner said. A ramjet is typically most efficient at two or three times the speed of sound.\n", "中文原文": "5月10日军方高级官员称，军方已经测试了一种冲压发动机，该发动机可以为未来的增程型精确打击导弹提供动力。PrSM的未来增量，即将取代陆军战术导弹系统，预计将具有反舰导引头，增加杀伤力和扩大射程。但军方此前没有表示额外的射程将来自冲压发动机。陆军高级采购和现代化官员在今天提交给参议院武装部队战术空军和陆军小组委员会听证会的证词中披露了冲压发动机计划和以前的测试。书面证词称：“我们成功测试了陆基反舰导弹导引头和增程推进冲压发动机，为PrSM计划的后续增量创造了条件。”冲压发动机是一种依靠高速前进运动来压缩空气的吸气发动机。与传统的喷气发动机不同，冲压发动机不需要风扇来压缩空气。退役陆军二星上将、消防卓越中心前主任阿尔·肖夫纳（Al Shoffner）告诉《国防内幕》(Inside Defens)，与燃料中携带氧化剂的更传统的导弹相比，冲压发动机将以更轻的重量提供更大的射程。“它比传统火箭或导弹的优势是，它不必携带那么多燃料，因为它在旅行时与氧气混合，”肖夫纳说。“这允许一些事情：第一，减轻重量，这非常关键，然后为其他需要有效载荷的东西提供更多空间，如制导系统和弹头。”他说，陆军以前没有用冲压发动机部署过系统。它们一直是研究的主题“很长一段时间”，技术近年来有所改进。肖夫纳说：“我认为我们已经到了这样一个地步，即我们更有信心这确实会奏效，而且可以证明这一点。”陆军应用研究预算文件详细计划为未来的PrSM变体开发“吸气推进子系统”，这可能是冲压发动机计划。根据预算文件，陆军“将在2023财年完成飞行重量联合循环吸气推进子系统的设计，并开始制造和集成，以进行后续实验和评估”。预算要求包括用于这一工作的880万美元。根据预算文件，FY-22的实验将探索相同的“吸气推进子系统”以“与传统固体推进剂火箭发动机子系统相同的形状因子”增加导弹射程的能力。这些科学和技术的发展将为未来增程PrSM增量的射程要求提供信息，陆军远程精确火力跨职能小组主任在10月份告诉《国防内幕》。PrSM已经成为陆军远程火力现代化优先考虑的主要项目之一，它预计这将是未来大规模作战所必需的。该导弹与现有的火箭发射器兼容，两个PRSM可以安装在同一个装有单个ATACMS的火箭吊舱中。根据陆军预算文件，根据紧急物资释放，初步增加的PrSM将在FY-23年底部署。该基地导弹将有至少500公里的射程，尽管确切的能力目前尚不清楚。根据前陆军未来司令部司令的说法，在10月份的最大距离测试中，遥测数据停止在499公里，但导弹飞得更远。基地PrSM的初始作战测试计划在FY-25的第一季度进行，该导弹可能在当年第四季度达到初始作战能力。PrSM增量2与猎舰导引头的演示可以在FY-27开始时进行，该导弹的变体可以在FY-27结束时部署。随后将增加3和4，增加杀伤力和扩大射程。陆军已经资助了冲压发动机的研究，这种发动机可以扩大加农炮的射程。一发子弹将使用传统的火炮推进剂从大炮中发射出来，一旦子弹达到足够高的速度，冲压发动机就可以打开。肖夫纳说，冲压发动机动力导弹仍然需要传统的导弹推进，以便能够达到冲压发动机工作所需的速度。冲压发动机的效率通常是声速的两到三倍。", "中文源标题": "陆军测试了未来PrSM变体的冲压发动机", "英文整编": "In his testimony to the Armed Forces Committee of the Senate on May 10, the senior officials of the US Army revealed that the shore-based anti-ship missile seeker and the \"Extended Range Propulsion\" (ERP) ramjet test have been successfully completed, and both of them are expected to be equipped with \"Precision Strike Missile\" (PrSM) in the future."}, {"中文标题": "吉尔吉斯斯坦采购土耳其“矛隼”和“突袭者”无人机", "情报来源": "土耳其defensehere网站", "时间": "2022年11月26日", "整编内容": "吉尔吉斯斯坦国家安全委员会主席披露，吉尔吉斯斯坦已经采购了土耳其的“突袭者”（AKINCI）和“矛隼”（AKSUNGUR）无人机，并成为土耳其“矛隼”无人机的第一个外国客户。吉尔吉斯斯坦预计将使用“突袭者”以及TB2无人机沿着塔吉克斯坦边境执行侦察和监视任务，也有可能使用“矛隼”无人机执行作战任务。\n土耳其海军、空军和特种部队正在积极使用“矛隼”无人机。“矛隼”无人机是土耳其航空工业公司研制的中空长航时无人机，是“安卡”无人机的一种更大的先进型号，能够昼夜执行情报、监视、侦察和攻击任务，还可用于电子和信号情报行动。该无人机长11.6米，翼展24米；最大升限12192米，作战半径250千米，最大载荷750千克，最大起飞重量3300千克；由两台TEI PD-170涡轮增压发动机提供动力，最高速度180千米/小时；在一次攻击/海军巡逻任务中，能以750千克外部载荷飞行12小时，在一次信号情报任务中，能以150千克有效载荷飞行24小时；配有6个挂点，其中每个机翼三个挂点，从内到外额定重量分别为500千克、300千克和150千克；可搭载多种武器系统，包括MAM-L激光制导炸弹、 MAM-C微型空地导弹、Cirit激光制导火箭弹、L-UMTAS反坦克导弹、TEBER-81激光制导炸弹、 TEBER-82激光制导炸弹、KGK-82制导炸弹、HGK-3制导炸弹和微型炸弹。\n2020年8月，“矛隼”无人机搭载12枚MAM-L激光制导炸弹进行了飞行试验。此外，土耳其还利用“矛隼”无人机测试了洛克桑公司为Mk-82通用炸弹开发的TEBER-82制导套件和土耳其联合科学技术研发委员会与土耳其国防工业研究发展学会开发的KGK-S?HA-82制导套件。\n“突袭者”无人机是土耳其拜卡尔公司最新推出的产品，长12.5米，翼展20米，高4.1米；最大起飞重量5500千克，续航时间25小时，最大速度361千米/小时；具有8个挂点，可搭载多种武器系统。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "北方科技信息研究所", "源网址": "https://www.overtdefense.com/2022/11/08/kyrgyzstan-to-purchase-aksungur-uavs-from-turkey-after-acquiring-bayraktar-tb2-and-bayraktar-akinci-drones/", "源标题": "Kyrgyzstan To Purchase Aksungur UAVs From Turkey After Acquiring Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Ak?nc?

With this, it was made apparent that Kyrgyzstan is AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer.\nThe Kyrgyzstan National Security State Committee’s press center and TAI have not made an official statement about how many AKSUNGUR drones Kyrgyzstan will purchase, what configurations these UAVs will be in, or the cost of the deal. Kyrgyzstan, which had previously purchased Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Ak?nc? drones from Turkey, also did not share the specifics of those agreements. Kyrgyzstan is expected to use these vehicles, along with Bayraktar TB2 and Ak?nc? drones, primarily in reconnaissance and surveillance operations along the Tajikistan border. Kyrgyzstan, which has frequent border disputes with Tajikistan, is also likely to employ Aksungur’s combat capabilities.\nFollowing its first export success with Kyrgyzstan, Aksungur’s next customer appears to be Indonesia. TAI General Manager Temel Kotil told SavunmaSanayiST at the Indo Defense Expo & Forum 2022 Fair held in Jakarta from November 2-5 that Indonesia needs ANKA and AKSUNGUR unmanned aerial vehicles. “We don’t discuss ventures that haven’t signed a contract,” Kotil continued in his statement, “but we will continue to discuss all of these products with the authorities here, and I’m hoping for good news from Indonesia.” Furthermore, TAI UAV Systems Deputy General Manager Dr. ?mer Y?ld?z told Anadolu Agency in September that two of three African countries are interested in purchasing Aksungur drones, with one interested in Anka UAVs. Furthermore, the Algerian-based MENADefense website reported last month that Algeria had ordered six TAI AKSUNGUR UAVs. According to the reports, Algeria was AKSUNGUR’s first foreign customer with this deal. TAI, however, later denied this information.\nThe Turkish Navy, Air Force, and Special Missions (MT) are currently actively using the Aksungur, an advanced and larger version of the ANKA unmanned aerial vehicle. According to TAI, the Aksungur’s developer, the drone is a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) class capable of performing Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and offensive operations day and night with EO/IR, SAR, and SIGINT payloads. In addition to its many other uses, Aksungur can be used for electronic and signal intelligence operations.\nAksungur has a length of 11.6 meters, a wingspan of 24 meters, a maximum take-off weight of 3300 kilograms, and a cargo capacity of 750 kilograms. Due to two TEI PD-170 turbo diesel engines with three-bladed propellers, the drone has 340 horsepower and a top speed of 100 knots (180 km/h) at sea level. The drone can fly for 12 hours with 750 kg of external payload during an Assault/Naval Patrol Mission, and 24 hours with 150 kg of payload during a Signal Intelligence Mission. Each of Aksungur’s wings has three pylons. From the inside out, they’re rated to carry loads weighing 500, 300, and 150 kg. Aksungur’s weapon options, according to TAI’s official page, include the MAM-L, MAM-C, Cirit, L-UMTAS, TEBER-81, TEBER-82, KGK-82, HGK-3, and the Miniature Bomb. Until now, the Aksungur drone has flown with 12 MAM-Ls in August 2020. Furthermore, Aksungur tested the TEBER-82 guidance kit developed by Roketsan for Mk-82 type general purpose bombs and the KGK-S?HA-82 developed by TUBITAK SAGE.

Options have included either a modernized F135 “Enhanced Engine Package” or an advanced engine from AETP, which would provide substantial increases in performance and efficiency.\nEngines from AETP are likely to power the Air Force’s planned sixth-generation fighter, the Next Generation Air Dominance platform. But both Congress and the Air Force has expressed an interest in getting those engines on the F-35 as well—lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring such a change starting in 2027, and Kendall said early in his tenure that he’d like to do so if it’s affordable.\nThat, however, has been a major sticking point. The Joint Program Office has made clear that any member of the F-35 program that wants to be “different” has to pay the full cost for that, which would include the development and integration of the AETP engines.\nIt’s unclear whether the Navy, the Marine Corps, or any of the other nations in the F-35 program are interested in splitting the costs of such an effort with the Air Force. GE Aviation, the maker of one of the AETP engines, has said its engine wouldn’t be able to go in the Marines’ F-35Bs, though it would fit on the Navy’s F-35Cs.\nNone of the other services or partners have agreed on the need for the AETP engine, Kendall confirmed to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine).\n“Each of the services and each of our partners is in a different situation with regard to the economics of doing that and the performance requirements,” Kendall said. “We have the largest fleet in the Air Force—we will have the largest fleet. So we have the greatest interest in this, I think, but there’s a significant cost associated with a brand new engine, development of that. It’s less expensive to do an upgrade, perhaps, and get increased performance, and then there are other options in between.”\nWith so many different perspectives and needs to juggle, Kendall said that the Office of the Secretary of Defense will need to make a final call on any changes, seemingly hinting that the Air Force won’t look to “go it alone” with their own separate effort.\n“The Department of Defense has to make a decision overall about engine modifications and upgrades for the F-35.

The US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system provides the upper tier of a multilayered missile defense system and is capable of intercepting missiles at altitudes of 40-150 km in their terminal phase.\nBut South Korea has particularly strived to build up homegrown middle and upper-tier missile defenses — which have not yet developed — against mounting North Korean missile threats.\n“The long-range surface-to-air missile, L-SAM, is a weapon system that intends to intercept missiles at higher altitudes than the Cheongung II, and we have been conducting flight tests of guided missiles and missile interception tests aiming to complete system development by 2024,” Eom said.\n“Our goal is to mass produce and deploy the L-SAM within two to three years after system development is completed in 2024.”\nThe L-SAM has been developed to shoot down hostile missiles at altitudes between 50 and 60 km, and then South Korea plans to upgrade the L-SAM to the L-SAM 2.\n“A pilot research on the L-SAM 2 has been underway,” Eom said. “If a series of the L-SAM (1 and 2) is deployed, we expect multilayered missile defense systems in the South Korean airspace will be further strengthened.”\nSouth Korea also seeks to precipitate the deployment of the Low Altitude Missile Defense (LAMD) system, which is analogous to Israel’s “Iron Dome” interceptor, in the capital and densely populated areas. The plan aims to counter threats posed by North Korea’s artillery and multiple rocket launchers.\n“We’ve carried out policy tasks including expeditious deployment of the long-range artillery interception system in order to strengthen the South Korean military’s system to counter threats posed by North Korea’s long-range artillery to the capital area,” Eom said.\n“The government has put efforts to reduce the time required to develop and deploy long-range artillery interceptor systems by minimizing administrative lead time and securing core technologies in advance before starting research and development in earnest.”\nSouth Korea commenced “exploratory development” of long-range artillery interceptor systems this year.\nEyes, ears on battlefield\nEom underscored the importance of South Korea’s efforts to domestically secure “cutting-edge military technologies” to complete the homegrown three-axis defense system.\nSouth Korea has pursued locally developing technologies for “surveillance and reconnaissance, command and control which is yet insufficient” to build the Kill Chain system, according to Eom.\nLocally developing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities is essential to complete the Kill Chain system.\nThe Kill Chain — which is the first axis of South Korea’s homegrown three-pronged defense system — intends to detect, locate and select enemy targets for action. The system therefore enables South Korea to conduct a preemptive attack against the enemy in case of contingency scenarios.\n“We also endeavor to develop independent ISR capabilities in multiple domains from space to ground,” Eom said, admitting South Korea’s high dependence on the US’ ISR assets.\n“In space, a project to develop military reconnaissance satellites (the 425 project) — which is the core of the Kill Chain system — has been underway without a hitch. If satellites are deployed by 2025 after conducting tests and evaluations beginning from 2023, it will contribute to improving our military’s independent surveilling capabilities.”\nIn the air, high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (HUAVs), airborne early warning and control aircraft and Baekdu reconnaissance aircraft have been deployed and monitored the entire Korean Peninsula.\nEom said South Korea is set to mass produce homegrown medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs). Testing and evaluation of the reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle-II to be operated by corps-level units have been in progress.\nOn the ground, South Korea has operated Green Pine anti-ballistic missile radars to detect and track ballistic missiles while “researching and developing a project to replace imported, obsolete long-range radars.”\nSouth Korea plans to begin to deploy first locally developed long-range radars from 2026, according to Eom.\nSouth Korea’s long-range radars will monitor and detect targets including aircraft in the Korea Air Defense Identification Zone (KADIZ) and send data to the Air Force’s Master Control and Reporting Center for air defense. At the MCRC, the Air Force monitors the South and North Korean airspace around the clock and controls and commands all aircraft flying over the Korean Peninsula as well as air defense assets.\nIn addition, South Korea plans to commence the development of a microsatellite system this December and put dozens of microsatellites in clusters into orbit by 2030.\nEom underlined that the interconnected operation of military spy satellites and ultrasmall satellite constellations will reduce revisit times for satellites, which is the time interval between observations of the same location on Earth by satellites.\n“South Korea’s surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities will be improved if the country can shorten revisit times over the Korean Peninsula by operating high-performance military reconnaissance satellites and microsatellite systems in a complementary manner.”\nEom explained that the DAPA has actively pushed forward various projects, including the 425 project and long-range artillery interception system, to “localize defense and combat systems, setting the goal of localization rate in producing components of each defense project is higher than 70 to 90 percent.”\nKF-21 exports\nThe DAPA head also stressed that South Korea’s first homegrown KF-21 fighter aircraft will “fill the security vacuum by replacing long-running fighter jets and contribute to defending territorial airspace and national security.”\nSouth Korea in July began a long journey of 2,200 test flights that will run until 2026. Around 120 KF-21 fighter jets will be deployed to South Korean Air Force bases by 2032.\nA 4.5th-generation KF-21 Boramae aircraft – which has very low observability compared to a fourth-generation fighter — will be assessed as cut out for the future battlefield, Eom explained, underscoring that KF-21 fighter aircraft will be utilized as the “core combat power of South Korea’s Air Force.”\nEom said South Korea is able to refurbish and upgrade domestic-made KF-21 fighter jets at discretion with proprietary technology, playing up to one of the advantages of domestically developing combat fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea has been running up against certain limitations when it seeks to upgrade imported foreign fighter jets to meet the military’s needs or arm imported fighter jets with domestically produced weapons. Such a process requires permission from a manufacturing country.\n“However, locally developed KF-21 aircraft will enable the development of its derivatives and localization of aircraft equipment and weapons to meet operational needs,” Eom said, adding that KF-21 fighter aircraft can be utilized as a part of a manned-unmanned-teaming (MUM-T) system should South Korea develop unmanned fighter aircraft.\nSouth Korea’s KF-21 will also gain a competitive edge against European rivals in the cut-throat global fighter aircraft market, Eom said.\nSouth Korea is bullish on the potential for exporting KF-21 fighter aircraft.\n“KF-21 fighter jet is expected to be competitive against Europe-produced aircraft in terms of aircraft acquisition cost, efficiency of aircraft maintenance and operations and operations and maintenance costs,” Eom said. The operational lifespan of a fighter jet is usually several decades.\nSouth Korea has also gained worldwide recognition for its technology through continuing exports of FA-50 light attack aircraft and T-50 advanced supersonic jet trainers.\n“We expect that KF-21 fighter aircraft will have export competitiveness in countries which plan to operate fourth or 4.5th-generation fighter jets instead of fifth-generation fighters as well as countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that have operated FA/T-50 aircraft,” Eom said.\n“The competitiveness of KF-21 aircraft will be further enhanced in the export market if we develop its ability to operate weapons by continuously developing domestic aircraft weapons and pursuing system integration as well as reduce costs in mass production by increasing production of aircraft.”\n", "中文原文": "首尔还将开发防御和监视系统，以提高军队对朝鲜日益增长的威胁的准备能力。首尔--韩国国家武器采购机构负责人告诉《韩国先驱报》，韩国正在开发国产作战武器、防御和监视系统，以加强军方对日益增长和持续的朝鲜威胁的威慑和准备态势。他说，迅速完成国产三轴防御系统--包括杀伤链先发制人打击机制、韩国空中和导弹防御系统(KAMD)和韩国大规模惩罚和报复系统(KMPR)--对实现这一目标至关重要。国防采办计划管理局(DAPA)部长Eom Dong-hwan在接受采访时说：“政府计划明年推进250项离散任务，包括发展武器系统和国防技术，以确保本土三轴防御系统的能力，加强韩国军方应对朝鲜不断升级的核和导弹威胁的能力。”韩国特别寻求建立一个多层导弹防御系统来完成KAMD，因为朝鲜开发了更有生存能力和机动性的弹道导弹，包括KN-23、KN-24和KN-25短程弹道导弹，以穿透和使导弹防御系统失效。美国制造的爱国者导弹拦截器和国产的清二型导弹--已经部署在韩国--可以在高达40公里的高度对抗来袭的弹道导弹。美国末段高空区域防御(THAAD)系统提供了多层导弹防御系统的上层，能够在导弹末段拦截40-150公里高度的导弹。但韩国特别努力建立尚未发展的国产中上层导弹防御系统，以应对日益增长的朝鲜导弹威胁。Eom说：“远程地对空导弹L-SAM是一种武器系统，旨在拦截比清空II更高海拔的导弹，我们一直在进行导弹飞行测试和导弹拦截测试，旨在到2024年完成系统开发。”“我们的目标是在2024年完成系统开发后的两到三年内量产并部署L-SAM。”L-SAM已经被开发用于击落50至60公里高度的敌对导弹，然后韩国计划将L-SAM升级为L-SAM 2。“关于L-SAM 2的试点研究已经在进行中，”Eom说。“如果一系列L-SAM（1和2）被部署，我们预计韩国领空的多层导弹防御系统将进一步加强。”韩国还寻求在首都和人口稠密地区加快部署低空导弹防御系统(LAMD)，该系统类似于以色列的“铁穹”拦截器。该计划旨在对抗朝鲜火炮和多管火箭炮构成的威胁。“我们已经执行了政策任务，包括快速部署远程火炮拦截系统，以加强韩国军方的系统，应对朝鲜远程火炮对首都地区构成的威胁，”Eom说。“政府已经努力减少开发和部署远程火炮拦截系统所需的时间，方法是在认真开始研发之前，最大限度地减少行政准备时间，并提前确保核心技术的安全。”韩国今年开始了远程火炮拦截系统的“探索性开发”。战场上的眼睛、耳朵Eom强调了韩国努力在国内保护“尖端军事技术”以完成国产三轴防御系统的重要性。据Eom称，韩国一直在当地开发“监视和侦察、指挥和控制技术，但这还不足以”建立杀伤链系统。在当地发展情报、监视、侦察(ISR)能力对完成杀伤链系统至关重要。杀伤链是韩国本土三管齐下防御系统的第一个轴心，旨在探测、定位和选择敌方目标进行行动。因此，该系统使韩国能够在紧急情况下对敌人进行先发制人的攻击。“我们还努力在从太空到地面的多个领域发展独立的ISR能力，”Eom说，承认韩国高度依赖美国的ISR资产。“在太空，一个开发军事侦察卫星的项目（425项目）--这是杀伤链系统的核心--一直在顺利进行。如果从2023年开始进行测试和评估后，到2025年部署卫星，将有助于改善", "中文源标题": "韩国研发国产武器对抗朝鲜威胁", "英文整编": "The head of South Korea's weapons acquisition agency said that South Korea is developing local combat weapons, defense and surveillance systems to enhance the deterrent power of the military and cope with the increasing North Korean threat.

The reduced costs for time, labor, maintenance and energy are expected to accelerate expansion of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing.", "原文": "\"The scan speed reduces costs significantly,\" said ORNL lead researcher Amir Ziabari. \"And the quality is higher, so the post-processing analysis becomes much simpler.\"\nThe framework is already being incorporated into software used by commercial partner ZEISS within its machines at DOE's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL, where companies hone 3D-printing methods.\nORNL researchers had previously developed technology that can analyze the quality of a part while it is being printed. Adding a high level of imaging accuracy after printing provides an additional level of trust in additive manufacturing while potentially increasing production.\n\"With this, we can inspect every single part coming out of 3D-printing machines,\" said Pradeep Bhattad, ZEISS business development manager for additive manufacturing. \"Currently CT is limited to prototyping. But this one tool can propel additive manufacturing toward industrialization.\"\nX-ray CT scanning is important for certifying the soundness of a 3D-printed part without damaging it. The process is similar to medical X-ray CT. In this case, an object set inside a cabinet is slowly rotated and scanned at each angle by powerful X-rays. Computer algorithms use the resulting stack of two-dimensional projections to construct a 3D image showing the density of the object's internal structure. X-ray CT can be used to detect defects, analyze failures or certify that a product matches the intended composition and quality.\nHowever, X-ray CT is not used at large scale in additive manufacturing because current methods of scanning and analysis are time-intensive and imprecise. Metals can totally absorb the lower-energy X-rays in the X-ray beam, creating image inaccuracies that can be further multiplied if the object has a complex shape. The resulting flaws in the image can obscure cracks or pores the scan is intended to reveal. A trained technician can correct for these problems during analysis, but the process is time- and labor-intensive.\nZiabari and his team developed a deep-learning framework that rapidly provides a clearer, more accurate reconstruction and an automated analysis. He will present the process his team developed during the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Image Processing in October.\nTraining a supervised deep-learning network for CT usually requires many expensive measurements. Because metal parts pose additional challenges, getting the appropriate training data can be difficult. Ziabari's approach provides a leap forward by generating realistic training data without requiring extensive experiments to gather it.\nA generative adversarial network, or GAN, method is used to synthetically create a realistic-looking data set for training a neural network, leveraging physics-based simulations and computer-aided design. GAN is a class of machine learning that utilizes neural networks competing with each other as in a game. It has rarely been used for practical applications like this, Ziabari said.\nBecause this X-ray CT framework needs scans with fewer angles to achieve accuracy, it has reduced imaging time by a factor of six, Ziabari said -- from about one hour to 10 minutes or less. Working that quickly with so few viewing angles would normally add significant \"noise\" to the 3D image.

These results were good, and ongoing trials at MDF are working to verify that the technique is equally effective with any type of metal alloy, Bhattad said.\nThat's important, because the approach developed by Ziabari's team could make it far easier to certify parts made from new metal alloys. \"People don't use novel materials because they don't know the best printing parameters,\" Ziabari said. \"Now, if you can characterize these materials so quickly and optimize the parameters, that would help move these novel materials into additive manufacturing.\"\nIn fact, Ziabari said, the technology can be applied in many fields, including defense, auto manufacturing, aerospace and electronics printing, as well as nondestructive evaluation of electric vehicle batteries.\n", "中文原文": "“扫描速度显著降低了成本，”ORNL首席研究员阿米尔·齐亚巴里说。“而且质量更高，所以后期处理分析变得简单多了。”该框架已经被商业合作伙伴蔡司在能源部位于ORNL的制造示范设施的机器中使用的软件集成，公司在那里磨练3D打印方法。ORNL的研究人员以前开发了一种技术，可以在印刷时分析零件的质量。在打印后增加高水平的成像精度提供了附加制造的额外信任水平，同时潜在地增加产量。蔡司增材制造业务发展经理普拉迪普·巴塔德（Pradeep Bhattad）表示：“有了这个，我们可以检查3D打印机的每一个零件。”“目前CT仅限于原型制造。但这一工具可以推动增材制造走向产业化。”X射线CT扫描对于证明3D打印零件的可靠性而不损坏它是很重要的。其过程类似于医用X线CT。在这种情况下，橱柜内的一个物体被缓慢旋转，并被强大的X射线以每个角度扫描。计算机算法使用得到的二维投影堆叠来构造显示物体内部结构密度的3D图像。X射线CT可以用来检测缺陷，分析故障或证明产品符合预期的成分和质量。然而，X射线CT在增材制造中没有得到大规模的应用，因为目前的扫描和分析方法耗时长且不精确。金属可以完全吸收X射线束中的低能量X射线，造成图像不准确，如果物体具有复杂的形状，这种不准确会进一步增加。由此产生的图像缺陷可能会掩盖扫描意图揭示的裂缝或孔隙。一个训练有素的技术人员可以在分析过程中纠正这些问题，但这个过程是费时费力的。Ziabari和他的团队开发了一个深度学习框架，可以快速提供更清晰、更准确的重建和自动化分析。他将在十月份的电气和电子工程师学会图像处理国际会议上介绍他的团队开发的过程。为CT训练一个有监督的深度学习网络通常需要许多昂贵的测量。由于金属部件带来了额外的挑战，获得适当的训练数据可能很困难。Ziabari的方法提供了一个飞跃，它生成了现实的训练数据，而不需要大量的实验来收集数据。一种生成对抗网络或GAN方法被用来综合地创建用于训练神经网络的逼真的数据集，利用基于物理的模拟和计算机辅助设计。GAN是一种机器学习，它利用神经网络相互竞争，就像在游戏中一样。它很少被用于像这样的实际应用，Ziabari说。Ziabari说，由于这种X射线CT框架需要更少角度的扫描才能达到精度，它将成像时间减少了6倍--从大约1小时减少到10分钟或更少。在如此少的视角下快速工作通常会给3D图像增加显著的“噪声”。但是在训练数据上教授的ORNL算法纠正了这一点，甚至将小缺陷检测提高了四倍或更多。Ziabari团队开发的框架将允许制造商快速微调他们的构建，即使在改变设计或材料的同时。Bhattad说，通过这种方法，样本分析可以在一天内完成，而不是六到八周。“如果我能以非常经济有效的方式非常迅速地检查整个部件，那么我们有100%的信心，”他说。“我们正在与ORNL合作，使CT成为一种方便和可靠的行业检查工具。”ORNL的研究人员使用复杂致密的材料，在数百个打印了不同扫描参数的样本上评估了新框架的性能。Bhattad说，这些结果很好，MDF正在进行的试验正在努力验证这项技术对任何类型的金属合金都同样有效。这很重要，因为Ziabari团队开发的方法可以使认证由新金属合金制成的零件变得更加容易。“人们不使用新颖的材料，因为他们不知道最好的印刷参数，”齐亚巴里说。“现在，如果你能这么快地表征这些材料并优化参数，这将有助于将这些新材料转移到增材制造领域。”Ziabari说，事实上，该技术可应用于多个领域，包括国防、汽车制造、航空航天和电子印刷，以及电动汽车电池的无损评估。", "中文源标题": "能源部橡树岭国家实验室开发的一种新的深度学习框架正在加快使用X射线计算机断层扫描或CT检查额外制造的金属零件的过程，同时提高结果的准确性。时间、劳动力、维护和能源成本的降低预计将加速增材制造或3D打印的扩张。", "英文整编": "Oak Ridge National Laboratory of the US Department of Energy has developed a new deep learning framework, which can speed up the process of X-ray computed tomography (CT) detection of metal parts manufactured by additives, reduce time, manpower and energy costs and improve accuracy.X-ray CT scanning can scan and analyze the internal structure of 3D printed components without damaging them, and can be used to detect defects, analyze faults or prove that the product quality meets expectations.

It is often necessary for technicians to correct it in the analysis process, which is time-consuming and laborious, and hinders the large-scale use of CT in additive manufacturing.Therefore, the research team adopted the machine learning method of Generating Countermeasure Network (GAN) to create real CT training data, thus shortening the imaging time by 6 times, improving the accuracy of small defect detection by more than 4 times, and shortening the analysis time of 3D printed samples from 6-8 weeks to 1 day.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School are harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve this goal. They have developed a machine learning super-resolution algorithm that generates synthetic images with high spatial resolution from lower resolution brain MRI scans.\nThe convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm, known as LF-SynthSR, converts low-field-strength (0.064 T) T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI sequences into isotropic images with 1 mm spatial resolution and the appearance of a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) acquisition. Describing their proof-of-concept study in Radiology, the researchers report that the synthetic images exhibited high correlation with images acquired by 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners.\nPrincipal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\nMorphometry, the quantitative size and shape analysis of structures in an image, is central to many neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, most MRI analysis tools are designed for near-isotropic, high-resolution acquisitions and typically require T1-weighted images such as MP-RAGE. Their performance often drops rapidly as voxel size and anisotropy increase. As the vast majority of existing clinical MRI scans are highly anisotropic, they cannot be reliably analysed with existing tools.\n“Millions of low-resolution brain MR images are produced every year, but currently cannot be analysed with neuroimaging software,” explains principal investigator Juan Eugenio Iglesias. “The main goal of my current research is to develop algorithms that make low-resolution brain MR images look like the high-resolution MRI scans that we use in research. I am particularly interested in two applications: enabling automated 3D analysis of the clinical scans and use with portable, low-field MRI scanners.”\nTraining and testing\nLF-SynthSR is built upon SynthSR, a method developed by the team to train a CNN to predict 1 mm-resolution MP-RAGE isotropic scans from routine clinical MR scans. Previous findings reported in NeuroImage showed that SynthSR-generated images could be reliably used for subcortical segmentation and volumetry, image registration and, if some quality requirements are met, even cortical thickness morphometry.\nBoth LF-SynthSR and SynthSR are trained on synthetic input images of highly varying appearance generated from 3D segmentations, and can thus be used to train CNNs for any combination of contrast, resolution and orientation.\nIglesias points out that neural networks perform best when data appear approximately constant, but every hospital uses scanners from different vendors that are configured differently, resulting in highly heterogeneous scans. “To tackle this problem, we are borrowing ideas from a field of machine learning called ‘domain randomization’, where you train neural networks with synthetic images that are simulated to constantly change appearance and resolution, in order to obtain trained networks that are agnostic to the appearance of the input images,” he explains.\nTo assess the performance of LF-SynthSR, the researchers correlated brain morphology measurements between synthetic MRIs and ground-truth high-field strength images. For training, they used a high-field-strength MRI dataset of 1-mm isotropic MP-RAGE scans from 20 subjects. They also used corresponding segmentations of 36 brain regions-of-interest (ROIs) and three extracerebral ROIs. The training set was also artificially augmented to better model pathologic tissue such as stroke or haemorrhage.\nThe test set comprised imaging data from 24 participants with neurological symptoms who had a low-field strength (0.064 T) scan in addition to a standard-of-care high-field strength (1.5–3 T) MRI. The algorithm successfully generated 1-mm isotropic synthetic MP-RAGE images from the low-field strength brain MRIs, with voxels more than 10 times smaller than in the original data. Automated segmentation of the synthetic images from a final sample of 11 participants yielded ROI volumes that were highly correlated with those derived from the high-field strength MR scans.\n“LF-SynthSR may improve the image quality of low-field strength MRI scans to the point that they are usable not only by automated segmentation methods but potentially also with registration and classification algorithms,” the researchers write. “It could also be used to augment the detection of abnormal lesions.”\nThis ability to analyse low-resolution brain MRIs using automated morphometry would enable the study of rare diseases and populations that are under-represented in current neuroimaging research. In addition, improving the quality of images from portable MRI scanners would enhance their use in medically underserved areas, as well as in critical care, where moving patients to an MRI suite is often too risky.\nIglesias says that another challenge is the wide range of abnormalities found in clinical scans that need to be handled by the CNN. “Currently, SynthSR works well with healthy brains, cases with atrophy, and smaller abnormalities like small multiple sclerosis lesions or small strokes,” he tells Physics World. “We are currently working to improve the method so it can effectively deal with larger lesions, like larger strokes or tumours.”\nWriting in an accompanying editorial in Radiology, Birgit Ertl-Wagner and Matthias Wagner from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto comment: “This exciting technical development study demonstrates the potential to go low on field strength and aim high for spatial and contrast resolution using artificial intelligence.”\n", "中文原文": "便携式低场强MRI系统具有改变神经成像的潜力--前提是它们的低空间分辨率和低信噪比可以被克服。哈佛医学院的研究人员正在利用人工智能(AI)来实现这一目标。他们开发了一种机器学习超分辨率算法，可以从低分辨率的大脑MRI扫描中生成高空间分辨率的合成图像。卷积神经网络(CNN)算法LF-SynthSR将低场强(0.064T)T1和T2加权脑MRI序列转换为空间分辨率为1 mm的各向同性图像，并显示出T1加权磁化准备快速梯度回波（MP-RAGE）采集。在描述他们在放射学中的概念验证研究时，研究人员报告说，合成图像与1.5T和3.0T MRI扫描仪获得的图像显示出高度相关性。马萨诸塞州总医院和哈佛医学院的首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯。形态计量学是对图像中结构的定量大小和形状分析，是许多神经影像学研究的核心。不幸的是，大多数MRI分析工具是为近各向同性、高分辨率采集而设计的，通常需要T1加权图像，如MP-RAGE。它们的性能往往随着体素尺寸和各向异性的增加而迅速下降。由于绝大多数现有的临床MRI扫描是高度各向异性的，它们不能用现有的工具进行可靠的分析。首席研究员胡安·尤金尼奥·伊格莱西亚斯解释说：“每年产生数百万张低分辨率脑部磁共振图像，但目前无法用神经成像软件进行分析。”“我目前研究的主要目标是开发算法，使低分辨率大脑MR图像看起来像我们在研究中使用的高分辨率MRI扫描。我对两个应用特别感兴趣：实现临床扫描的自动化三维分析和便携式低场MRI扫描仪的使用。“培训和测试LF-SynthSR是建立在SynthSR的基础上的，这是一种由该小组开发的方法，用于训练CNN从常规临床MR扫描中预测1毫米分辨率的MP-RAGE各向同性扫描。先前在NeuroImage上报道的发现表明，SynthSR生成的图像可以可靠地用于皮层下分割和体积测量、图像配准，如果满足某些质量要求，甚至可以用于皮层厚度形态测量。LF-SynthSR和SynthSR都是在从3D分割产生的高度变化外观的合成输入图像上训练的，因此可以用于训练CNNs的对比度、分辨率和方向的任何组合。Iglesias指出，当数据看起来近似恒定时，神经网络表现最好，但每家医院使用来自不同供应商的扫描仪，这些扫描仪的配置不同，导致扫描高度异构。他解释说：“为了解决这个问题，我们借鉴了一个名为‘领域随机化’的机器学习领域的思想，在这个领域中，你用模拟的合成图像来训练神经网络，以不断改变外观和分辨率，从而获得对输入图像的外观不可知的训练网络。”为了评估LF-SynthSR的性能，研究人员将合成MRIs和地面高场强图像之间的大脑形态测量进行了关联。为了训练，他们使用了来自20名受试者的1毫米各向同性MP-RAGE扫描的高场强MRI数据集。他们还使用了36个脑感兴趣区和3个脑外感兴趣区的相应分段。训练集还被人工增强，以更好地模拟病理组织，如中风或出血。该测试集包括24名有神经症状的参与者的影像学数据，他们除了接受标准护理高场强(1.5-3T)MRI之外，还接受了低场强(0.064T)扫描。该算法成功地从低场强脑磁共振成像中生成了1-mm各向同性合成MP-RAGE图像，体素比原始数据小10倍以上。对来自11名参与者的最终样本的合成图像进行自动分割，得到的ROI体积与高场强MR扫描的结果高度相关。研究人员写道：“LF-SynthSR可能会改善低场强MRI扫描的图像质量，以至于它们不仅可以通过自动分割方法使用，还可能通过配准和分类算法使用。”“它还可以用来加强异常病变的检测.”这种使用自动形态计量分析低分辨率脑部磁共振成像的能力将使研究罕见疾病和在当前神经成像研究中未得到充分体现的人群成为可能。此外，提高便携式MRI扫描仪的图像质量将提高其在医疗服务不足的地区以及重症监护中的应用", "中文源标题": "人工智能从低场强磁共振扫描中创建高分辨率大脑图像", "英文整编": "Recently, Harvard Medical School has achieved the goal of overcoming the low spatial resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system by using artificial intelligence technology.

Germany selected the missile to meet its Leichtes Wirkmittel 1800+ requirement.\nThe Enforcer shoulder launched weapon system provides low-collateral precision effects capabilities against the threat from lightly armoured static and moving targets, targets behind cover, and against targets at long range also in urban environments. Enforcer is a 2km-class disposable shoulder-launched guided munition, which provides stand-off capability for forces while engaging targets on the battlefield. The missile weighs less than 7kg and the system along with sight and two munitions weighs less than 20kg. The combined weight of the missile and the launch tube is less than 9kg. The weapon can engage targets within the range between 1,000m and 2,000m. The compact size and dimension of the missile make it more efficient and easier to carry and use in asymmetrical conflict zones.\nEnforcer possesses increased capabilities than the existing infantry weapon systems. The missile is equipped with a lock-on before launch (LOBL) feature. The fire-and-forget missile has the capability to destroy lightly-armoured and soft-skinned targets. It is also effective against hidden targets due to its airburst capabilities. The weapon system has been designed to have the lowest possible collateral damage, and can be easily operable by a single soldier. The missile’s seeker head guides it directly to the centre of the predetermined target. Enforcer has the capacity to perform day and night operations and displays firing capability in enclosed spaces. It carries a multi-effect warhead that can hit targets with high precision over full range.\nThe modular design of the Enforcer system enables a range of future development options, including a prospective ‘family’ of Enforcer munitions for land, air and sea applications. The shoulder-launched Enforcer missile serves as a basis for a new air-launched variant called Enforcer Air. Enforcer Air was unveiled at the Berlin Security Conference 2019 held in Berlin, in November 2019. Enforcer Air has been developed by MBDA Deutschland. It comes with various launching options including drop-launched, tube-launched and rail-launched. The missile can be carried by helicopters, tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and medium-latitude long-endurance (MALE) UAVs. The air-launched missile is primarily being offered to Germany.\n", "中文原文": "MBDA在国防和安全设备国际(DSEI)2021上展示了强制者轻量级高精度导弹系统。MBDA在完成演示方案后，于2014年开始开发强制者紧凑型导弹系统。在德国领导的多国MBDA项目下开发的Enforcer是MBDA最大的自筹资金项目之一。开发阶段包括2016年11月在德国联邦国防军武器弹药技术中心91进行的多次制导射击。2019年12月，MBDA与德国签署了一项合同，为德国武装部队提供强制者导弹系统。德国选择这种导弹是为了满足其Leichtes Wirkmittel 1800+的要求。强制者肩部发射武器系统提供了低附带精度效果的能力，以对抗来自轻装甲静态和移动目标、掩护后目标的威胁，以及城市环境中的远程目标。强制者是一种2km级一次性肩射制导弹药，为部队在战场上与目标交战时提供对峙能力。导弹重量不到7千克，系统连同瞄准具和两枚弹药重量不到20千克。导弹和发射管的总重量不到9千克。该武器可以与1000米至2000米范围内的目标交战。这种导弹的体积和尺寸紧凑，使其在不对称的冲突地区更有效、更易于携带和使用。强制者拥有比现有步兵武器系统更大的能力。该导弹配备了发射前锁定(LOBL)功能。发射-忘记导弹有能力摧毁轻装甲和软皮肤目标。由于它的空袭能力，它对隐藏目标也很有效。该武器系统被设计为具有尽可能低的附带伤害，并且可以很容易地由一名士兵操作。导弹的导引头直接将其引导到预定目标的中心。强制者有能力执行白天和夜间的行动，并在封闭的空间中显示发射能力。它携带一个多效弹头，可以在全射程内高精度打击目标。强制执行器系统的模块化设计使未来的一系列发展选择成为可能，包括未来的“家庭”强制执行器弹药用于陆地、空中和海上应用。肩射强制者导弹是一种新的空中发射变体的基础，称为强制者空中。Enforcer Air于2019年11月在柏林举行的2019年柏林安全会议上亮相。强制空气已开发的MBDA德国。它有各种发射选择，包括下降发射，管状发射和铁路发射。该导弹可由直升机、战术无人机和中纬度长航时(MALE)无人机携带。这种空射导弹主要是提供给德国的。", "中文源标题": "MBDA在DSEI展示强制者轻型高精度导弹系统", "英文整编": "MBDA, a European multinational missile manufacturer, demonstrated the shoulder-mounted Enforcer high-precision missile system at the 2021 International Exhibition of Defense and Security Equipment (DSEI).Shoulder-mounted Enforcer missile system has low collateral damage precision strike capability, which can attack static and mobile light armored targets within 1000 meters to 2000 meters, targets behind bunkers and long-distance targets in urban environment, and can provide troops with out-of-zone defense capability while engaging battlefield targets.

The National Defense Industrial Association is raising concerns about the defense-industrial base's health. (Lockheed Martin)\nWASHINGTON ― Lawmakers voiced worries on Wednesday about the health of the defense-industrial base in a House hearing where trade leaders said spending volatility and red tape make it tough for industry to surge capacity.\nAmid broader discussions in the House about potential Pentagon budget cuts, members of the House Armed Services Committee offered a sympathetic forum for the defense sector as important to national security and an economic engine. For their part, leaders with the Aerospace Industries Association, National Defense Industrial Association and Shipbuilders Council of America said industry would respond best to stable demand from government.\n“We cannot prevail in any conflict without a ready, strong and adaptable industrial base. Yet the defense-industrial base is experiencing a multitude of challenges,” said the panel’s chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala. “Some of these include inflation, workforce shortages, bureaucratic hurdles and supply chains that remain too dependent on foreign sources of materials.”\nAmid calls from industry for the administration to adjust otherwise firm-fixed-price contracts to account for inflation, Rogers said the administration “refuses to use the authorities and resources Congress gave them last year to provide necessary relief.”\nIndustry representatives at the hearing said the lack of adjustments hurts companies by depressing wages as the sector grapples with worker shortfalls.\nThe hearing was the second for the committee under the new Republican-led House. It comes amid concerns that Ukraine’s consumption of U.S.-supplied materiel is outstripping the capacity of American defense firms to quickly replenish it ― a negative sign as the U.S seeks to deter China.\nAsked about a Center for Strategic and International Studies report last month that found the U.S. defense-industrial base is unprepared for a notional battle with China over Taiwan, Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Eric Fanning said wavering demand stymies efforts to stockpile munitions or surge.\n“To have that capability to surge requires a consistent, long-term [government funding] commitment,” Fanning said, adding that some suppliers have become skittish about multiyear contracts, given the specter of inflation eating into profits.\nDespite growing U.S. defense spending and demand for arms fueled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the defense industry has signaled it won’t expand capacity without a firmer commitment from the government. The trade group chiefs lamented what they saw as overregulation, inconsistent defense spending and bureaucratic barriers for small business. They said uncertainty about Congress raising the debt limit adds a tricky variable.\n“Unfortunately, over the last several years industry has also experienced an unpredictable budget and volatile acquisition environment with repeated shifts in fleet-size [plans] that make [industry’s] CAPEX, or facility, decisions more difficult,” said Matthew Paxton, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America. “The most effective mechanism to ensure the industrial base is stable and resilient is through consistent demand and adequate funding.”\nThe panel’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith, argued that, given industry’s reluctance to increase its manufacturing capacity without a sustained commitment from the government, the U.S. will have to target investments to where it needs arms quickly and in large quantities.\n“We need to figure out what do we really need in the industrial base. You’re not going to be able to prepare for every conceivable contingency; we just don’t have the resources, and the private sector will not make that investment on a wish and a promise,” said Smith of Washington. “We need to be really strategic about it.”\nBoth Rogers and Smith voiced concern with the U.S. defense-industrial base’s reliance on China for critical minerals and semiconductors. Smith suggested that deeper industrial ties with allied nations and opportunities for smaller, innovative defense firms offer potential fixes.\nFanning echoed those concerns and suggested the government provide seed funding to take back a share of critical mineral processing, which China dominates. “It’s an issue for the federal government to help create that market, which is not easy to do,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, the National Defense Industrial Association released its annual report on the state of the U.S. defense-industrial base, which said indicators for industrial base readiness are trending in the wrong direction: The size of America’s defense workforce shrunk to 1.1 million from 3 million in 1985; in five years more than 17,000 companies stopped working in the defense sector; and defense spending as a share of the economy fell 45%.\nAt the hearing, the association’s president and CEO, David Norquist, said among the hindrances are fixed-price contracts that lock in labor rates and growing lags in the government’s security clearance process for private-sector workers.\nHe also suggested using immigration policies to grow the country’s pool of science and technology experts.\nLast week, the head of Naval Sea Systems Command said its “No. 1 strategic challenge” is hiring and retaining skilled workers, as the Navy and its suppliers have thousands of open jobs at government repair yards and in the private shipbuilding and ship repair sectors.\nRep. Joe Courtney of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, noted that the Pentagon’s budget plan calls for $1.6 billion in long-term investment in the Columbia-class nuclear submarine’s workforce, supply chain and facilities.\nThis prompted Paxton to say that sort of demand signal does get “bang for the buck.”\nAbout Joe Gould\nJoe Gould is the senior Pentagon reporter for Defense News, covering the intersection of national security policy, politics and the defense industry.

Led by Sayeef Salahuddin at the University of California, Berkeley, the team based their design around an ultrathin superlattice heterostructure, containing alternating layers of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric materials. The team says that its superlattice could be easily integrated into existing transistor designs, reducing their energy requirements.\nAs modern computers grow ever more powerful, the energy they consume is also growing with seemingly no end in sight. Slowing this trend will require fundamental changes to traditional transistor designs.\nMetal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are ubiquitous in computers and other electronics. They comprise a silicon semiconductor channel through which current can flow between two electrodes. The current flows past a third electrode called the gate, which is separated from the semiconductor channel by an insulating oxide layer. The gate electrode acts like one plate of a capacitor and by varying the voltage applied to the gate, the electronic properties of the silicon can be adjusted. The result is that the current flowing through the channel can be switched on and off.\nOpposite effect\nIn their study, Salahuddin’s team sought to improve this design by exploiting negative capacitance. This an effect that Salahuddin first predicted in 2008 and demonstrated experimentally in 2011. It occurs when a decrease in the voltage across a capacitor results in an increase in the charge stored in the device – the opposite of what happens in conventional capacitors.\nNegative capacitance arises in ferroelectric materials, whose spontaneous electric polarization can be reoriented with the application of an external electric field. To create negative capacitance, an insulating dielectric material is paired with a ferroelectric material – significantly amplifying the amount of charge that accumulates in a ferroelectric material at a given voltage.\nSalahuddin and colleagues have now demonstrated the effect in a new, ultra-thin superlattice material. It comprises alternating, atom-thick layers of the strongly dielectric, ferroelectric material, hafnium dioxide and the antiferroelectric compound zirconium dioxide – which displays zero spontaneous polarization.\nPerformance matching\nTo test their material’s capabilities, the researchers deposited a film of the superlattice just 2 nm thick onto a thin glass layer – separating from it from a silicon layer. In the resulting MOSFET, the team found that the gate voltage could be reduced by about 30%, which reduces the energy consumption of the device. The resulting device was able to match the performance of existing transistor designs.\nSince hafnium dioxide is already widely used in combination with silicon dioxide to form the insulating layers in MOSFETs, this design is highly compatible with existing manufacturing processes. As a result, Salahuddin and colleagues hope that their material could substantially reduce the amount of energy consumed by modern computers, without sacrificing their speed, performance, or small size.\nThe research is described in Nature.\n", "中文原文": "通过利用一种叫做负电容的奇怪效应，研究人员设计了一种晶体管，所需的栅极电压比传统设计低约30%。由加州大学伯克利分校的Sayeef Salahuddin领导的团队基于超薄超晶格异质结构进行设计，该异质结构包含交替的铁电和反铁电材料层。该团队表示，它的超晶格可以很容易地集成到现有的晶体管设计中，降低它们的能量需求。随着现代计算机变得越来越强大，它们消耗的能量也在增长，似乎看不到尽头。减缓这一趋势将需要对传统晶体管设计进行根本性的改变。金属氧化物半导体场效应晶体管（MOSFET）在计算机和其他电子设备中普遍存在。它们包括一个硅半导体通道，电流可以通过该通道在两个电极之间流动。电流流过称为栅极的第三个电极，该电极由绝缘氧化物层与半导体沟道隔开。栅电极的作用就像电容器的一块板，通过改变施加在栅上的电压，硅的电子特性可以被调节。其结果是流过通道的电流可以接通和断开。适得其反的效果在他们的研究中，Salahuddin的团队试图通过利用负电容来改进这种设计。这是萨拉赫丁在2008年首次预测并在2011年进行实验证明的效果。当电容器两端的电压降低导致存储在器件中的电荷增加时，它就会发生--这与传统电容器的情况相反。铁电材料中存在负电容，在外加电场作用下，铁电材料的自发电极化可以重新定向。为了产生负电容，绝缘介质材料与铁电材料配对--在给定电压下显著放大铁电材料中积累的电荷量。Salahuddin和他的同事现在已经在一种新的超薄超晶格材料中证明了这种效应。它由强介电铁电材料、二氧化铪和显示零自发极化的反铁电化合物二氧化锆组成，原子厚的交替层。性能匹配为了测试他们材料的性能，研究人员在一层薄玻璃层上沉积了一层仅2纳米厚的超晶格薄膜--与硅层隔开。在由此产生的MOSFET中，团队发现栅极电压可以降低约30%，这降低了器件的能耗。由此产生的器件能够与现有晶体管设计的性能相匹配。由于二氧化铪与二氧化硅结合在MOSFET中已经被广泛用于形成绝缘层，该设计与现有的制造工艺高度兼容。因此，Salahuddin和他的同事们希望他们的材料能在不牺牲速度、性能或小尺寸的情况下，大幅降低现代计算机消耗的能量。这项研究在《自然》杂志上有描述。", "中文源标题": "负电容可以使晶体管更节能", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a more energy-saving transistor.

The laser, DE M-SHORAD, is designed to shoot down enemy drones and artillery shells.\nIf the laser is successful, it could enter service as early as 2022.\nThe U.S. Army is finally putting a laser weapon on the ground.\nThe Directed Energy Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (DE M-SHORAD) system is designed to shoot down not only drones, but also incoming artillery, which has been a vexing problem on the battlefield for hundreds of years. The Army is set to field the first four lasers, mounted to armored vehicles, sometime next year.\nOver the summer, the Army tested DE M-SHORAD at Fort Bliss, home of the service's air defense artillery branch in Texas. The system uses a 50-kilowatt laser weapon system to concentrate a beam of focused laser light at a drone, heating the surface of its skin. In turn, this can cause aerodynamic failure, blind the drone's sensors, disable the engine, or even detonate the fuel supply or explosive payload.\nThis is useful, considering drone attacks are one of the most urgent issues that the Army is currently facing. Small, fast, and capable of carrying a lethal payload, the drone threat has quickly escalated from jury-rigged hobbyist drones to military-grade weapons capable of autonomously engaging enemy troops.\nAlthough the U.S. Army is the most dominant ground force in the world, it was not prepared for this threat, and has scrambled to catch up. DE M-SHORAD—the first Army ground laser weapon—is an outgrowth of this effort. The service plans to mount the laser weapons on Stryker infantry armored vehicles sometime in fiscal year 2022.\nAnother major capability of DE M-SHORAD is the ability to shoot down enemy artillery. For more than a century, the only way ground forces could respond to enemy rockets, mortars, and artillery shells was to dig in, move to another position, or attack the artillery directly. DE M-SHORAD, t he Army claims, can now intercept those munitions in mid- flight, preventing them from landing among friendly troops.\nThe Army has four DE M-SHORAD vehicles, but if the system works as planned, it will almost certainly buy dozens more. The service has nothing else like it for engaging enemy drones and artillery, and it has ten combat divisions and several separate brigades and regiments to protect.

That is a requirement for the program. And that will support our ability to deliver the number of aircraft we need to truly perform the missions that are outlined in the National Defense Strategy,” he said.\nThe program kicked off 12 years ago with a requirement for 100 aircraft at a cost of $550 million each in 2010 dollars. Officials say the current per-aircraft cost is classified, but with a cumulative rate of inflation of 36.7 percent, that comes to $751 million per aircraft in 2022 dollars.\nMaintaining steady numbers is critical to the Air Force as it divvies up funding for its own needs and engages in the yearly food fight with the Navy, Army and Marine Corps for finite taxpayer dollars to fund their priorities.\nAnd there will be many budget battles in the coming years that will put pressure on the B-21 program.\nJet fighters have their own advocates within the Air Force, which is trying to build out its F-35A Lightning II, field the F-15EX, maintain its legacy fleets and develop a sixth-generation Next Generation Air Dominance fighter.\nBombers are part of the nuclear triad along with submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nAll three are being modernized and replaced with completely new systems over the next decade, with the Air Force in charge of the Ground-Based Nuclear Deterrent ICBMs as well as upgrading the nuclear command and control infrastructure that ties the triad together. The Navy is building 12 Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines.\nMeanwhile, the Navy’s ultimate goal is to operate as many as 372 ships, the Army has a big modernization push and the Marines are retooling for 21st century conflicts in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn short, the B-21 Raider will have a lot of competition for Defense Department dollars over the next decade.\nAnd cutting the 100 number is no solution, as retired Air Force Col. Chris “Jekyll” Brunner, senior resident fellow for airpower studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, succinctly put it in a recent podcast.\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which Northrop Grumman also developed and manufactured, shows how the Air Force ended up with a $2 billion apiece aircraft, he said.\nThe service was supposed to acquire 132 B-2s, but out-of-control costs and the end of the Cold War prompted Congress to cut their numbers.\nThat put the program in a death spiral.\nBrunner said cutting aircraft numbers is counter-intuitive. “It increases the cost of the aircraft because you don’t have a large enough fleet to spread costs over, so it makes it incredibly hard to modernize and sustain, driving up bills.

They are being modernized, returning to the factory to be refurbished and updated every nine years.\nBut what of the Sprit’s eventual fate? If history is any guide, the Air Force will eventually build enough B-21s to the point where it will want to retire the B-2 and probably its predecessors, the B-1 Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress.\nBut Congress won’t allow it — finding some way to rationalize their existence — sticking the Air Force with ever-higher bills to sustain aging aircraft in the name of keeping jobs in their districts.\n", "中文原文": "空军的B-21突袭机旨在战胜强大的防空系统，向敌人领土深处的目标运送精确武器，并将其两名机组人员安全送回家园。但随着该计划的推进，一个更大的挑战是，该计划能否在国防部每年的资金争夺战中获胜，降低成本，并交付空军所说的保持其对对手的优势所需的100架飞机。空军和诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的官员在加州棕榈谷举行的B-21推出仪式上，不仅对该计划目前的成本，而且对未来需要多少资金做出了乐观的评估。空军负责采购、技术和后勤的副部长安德鲁·亨特告诉记者，到目前为止，该计划在成本和时间表上“跟踪良好”。“这个项目的一个关键方面是，我们有一个非常明确的成本目标。这是程序的要求。这将支持我们交付所需飞机数量的能力，以真正执行国防战略中概述的任务，“他说。该项目始于12年前，当时需要100架飞机，以2010年美元计算，每架成本为5.5亿美元。官员们表示，目前每架飞机的成本是分类的，但随着36.7%的累计通货膨胀率，以2022年美元计算，每架飞机的成本为7.51亿美元。保持稳定的数字对空军至关重要，因为它为自己的需求分配资金，并与海军、陆军和海军陆战队进行年度粮食斗争，以有限的纳税人资金资助他们的优先事项。未来几年将有许多预算之争，这将给B-21计划带来压力。喷气式战斗机在空军内部有自己的倡导者，空军正试图建造F-35A闪电II，部署F-15EX，保持其遗留机队，并开发第六代下一代空中优势战斗机。轰炸机与潜艇和洲际弹道导弹一起是核三位一体的一部分。未来十年，这三个系统都将现代化，并被全新的系统取代，空军负责地面核威慑洲际弹道导弹，并升级将这三个系统联系在一起的核指挥和控制基础设施。海军正在建造12艘哥伦比亚级弹道导弹核潜艇。与此同时，海军的最终目标是操作多达372艘船只，陆军正在大力推进现代化，海军陆战队正在为21世纪印度-太平洋的冲突进行重组。简而言之，B-21突袭机在未来十年将面临国防部资金的大量竞争。米切尔航空航天研究所航空动力研究高级常驻研究员、退役空军上校克里斯·杰基尔·布伦纳（Chris“Jekyll”Brunner）在最近的一个播客中简明扼要地指出，削减100个数字不是解决办法。他说，诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司也开发和制造的B-2幽灵隐形轰炸机表明，空军最终是如何获得每架20亿美元的飞机的。该服务本应获得132架B-2，但失控的成本和冷战的结束促使国会削减了它们的数量。这使该项目陷入了死亡螺旋。布伦纳说，削减飞机数量是违反直觉的。“这增加了飞机的成本，因为你没有足够大的机队来分散成本，所以这使得现代化和维持变得非常困难，增加了账单。这就是你如何得到一架价值20亿美元的飞机，“他说。他指出，这就是F-35A喷气式战斗机项目今天所面临的困境，因为空军希望每年获得大约72架A型战斗机，但没有达到目标。“从长远来看，你将推高维持成本，因为你没有购买你想要的舰队规模，”他说。“我对B-21最大的恐惧是我们最终会陷入B-2场景，”他说。空军不得不满足于21架B-2飞机--在其中一架坠毁后--现在是20架。它们正在现代化，每九年返回工厂进行翻新和更新。但是精神的最终命运如何呢？如果历史可以作为指导的话，空军最终将建造足够多的B-21，以至于它想让B-2退役，可能还有它的前身，B-1枪骑兵和B-52同温层堡垒。但国会不会允许它--找到某种方式来合理化他们的存在--以保持所在地区的工作为名，用越来越高的账单来维持空军老化的飞机。", "中文源标题": "分析:B-21突袭机的关键数字游戏", "英文整编": "With the advancement of the US Air Force B-21 Raider stealth bomber project, the challenges related to cost control, budget fund acquisition and delivery quantity completion have gradually become prominent.

The Boeing-owned MQ-25 test asset, known as T1, transferred fuel to an E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, the newest variant of the E-2 platform which was upgraded with an aerial refueling capability in 2019.\n“Once operational, the MQ-25 will refuel every receiver-capable platformincluding E-2,” said Capt. Chad Reed, the Navy’s Unmanned Carrier Aviation (PMA-268) program manager. “This flight keeps us on a fast track to getting the Stingray out to the fleet where its refueling capability will greatly increase the range and operational flexibility of the carrier air wing and strike group.”\nThis test marks the second refueling flight for the MQ-25 program. In June, the government/industry team completed the historic first unmanned tanking flight with an F/A-18 Super Hornet.\nDuring the six-hour flight, Navy E-2D pilots from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Zero (VX) 20 approached T1, performed formation evaluations, wake surveys, drogue tracking and plugs with the MQ-25 test asset at 220 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) and 10,000 feet. This test allows the program to analyze the aerodynamic interaction of the two aircraft. The team can then determine if any adjustments to guidance and control are required and make those software updates early, with no impact to the developmental test schedule.\nT1 testing will continue over the next several months to include flight envelope expansion, engine testing, and deck handling demonstrations aboard an aircraft carrier before the MQ-25 engineering, manufacturing and development aircraft are delivered next year.\n“MQ-25 is leading the way as naval aviation transforms to include cutting-edge unmanned platforms,” said Capt. Michael France, the Navy’s Airborne Command & Control and Logistics Wing (ACCLW) commodore. “Our fleet integration team (FIT)is actively preparing for the Stingray’s arrival and we’re excited for the innovative capabilities of the MQ-25 that will transform our mobility and power projection. For the first time, the eyes and ears of the fleet will now be able to provide up-to-the-minute information from deep within theater to facilitate rapid-decision making by carrier strike group leadership.”\nThe ACCLW will integrate the MQ-25A Stingray into the carrier air wing alongside the E-2 and C-2 squadrons. The Stingray’s persistent mission tanking coupled with the E-2D’s aerial refueling capability will transform the Hawkeye from an over-the-horizon airborne early warning platform limited to shorter missions in the carrier environment, to an asset capable of providing comprehensive battle management for extended periods from anywhere within the battlespace.\nThe MQ-25A FIT is working with PMA-268 and Boeing to ensure the end user(MQ-25 operators)have early input as the aircraft moves quickly from development through test. The Navy will begin standing up the fleet replacement squadron, Unmanned Carrier-Launched Multi Role Squadron (VUQ) 10, later this yearfollowed by two MQ-25A squadrons, VUQ-11 and 12. These squadrons will deploy detachments to the U.S. Navy’s aircraft carriers.\nMQ-25 will be the world’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft and provide critical aerial refueling and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that will greatly expand the global reach, operational flexibility and lethality of the Carrier Air Wing and Carrier Strike Group.

We have submitted data to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) – the World Air Sports Federation who control and certify world aeronautical and astronautical records – that at 15:45 (GMT) on 16 November 2021, the aircraft reached a top speed of 555.9 km/h (345.4 mph) over 3 kilometres, smashing the existing record by 213.04 km/h (132mph). In further runs at the UK Ministry of Defence’s Boscombe Down experimental aircraft testing site, the aircraft achieved 532.1km/h (330 mph) over 15 kilometres – 292.8km/h (182mph) faster than the previous record – and broke the fastest time to climb to 3000 metres by 60 seconds with a time of 202 seconds, according to our data. We hope that the FAI will certify and officially confirm the achievements of the team in the near future.\nDuring its record-breaking runs, the aircraft clocked up a maximum speed of 623 km/h (387.4 mph) which we believe makes the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ the world’s fastest all-electric vehicle.\nWarren East, CEO, Rolls-Royce, said: “Staking the claim for the all-electric world-speed record is a fantastic achievement for the ACCEL team and Rolls-Royce. I would like to thank our partners and especially Electroflight for their collaboration in achieving this pioneering breakthrough. The advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Advanced Air Mobility market. Following the world’s focus on the need for action at COP26, this is another milestone that will help make ‘jet zero’ a reality and supports our ambitions to deliver the technology breakthroughs society needs to decarbonise transport across air, land and sea.”\nBusiness Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: “Rolls-Royce’s revolutionary Spirit of Innovation aircraft is yet more proof of the UK’s enviable credentials when it comes to innovation. This record will show the potential of electric flight and help to unlock the technologies that could make it part of everyday life. The government is proud to back projects like this to leverage the private investment necessary to unlock cleaner, greener aircraft which will allow people to fly as they do now, but in a way that cuts emissions.”\nThe ‘Spirit of Innovation’ is part of the ACCEL or ‘Accelerating the Electrification of Flight’ project. Half of the project’s funding is provided by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), in partnership with the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy and Innovate UK.\nThe aircraft was propelled on its record breaking runs by a 400kW (500+hp) electric powertrain and the most power-dense propulsion battery pack ever assembled in aerospace. We worked in partnership with aviation energy storage specialist Electroflight and automotive powertrain supplier YASA. As well as a stunning technical achievement, the project and world record runs provided important data for our future electric power and propulsion systems for all-electric urban air mobility and hybrid-electric commuter aircraft.The characteristics that ‘air-taxis’ require from batteries, for instance, are very similar to what was developed for the ‘Spirit of Innovation’.\nStjohn Youngman, Managing Director, Electroflight. “We are delighted to have played an integral role in this landmark project. Its success is a fitting tribute to the dedication and innovation of the Electroflight team and our suppliers. Developing the propulsion and battery system, in collaboration with experienced program partners, has resulted in a world class engineering capability that will lead the way towards the decarbonisation of air travel. Our next step is to adapt this pioneering technology so it can be applied across the wider aerospace industry to deliver a more sustainable way to fly.”\nRolls-Royce has an incredible history of flying speed record attempts and breaking records, dating back to the Schneider Trophies of the early 1930s. The speed achieved by test pilot and Rolls-Royce Director of Flight Operations Phill O’Dell in the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ was more than 213.04 km/h (132 mph) faster than the previous record set by the Siemens eAircraft powered Extra 330 LE Aerobatic aircraft in 2017. Never in the history of the FAI record attempts has there been such a significant increase in speed over such a short time, highlighting the rapid pace at which electrification of aerospace is advancing.\nPhill O’Dell said: “Flying the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ at these incredible speeds and believing we have broken the world-record for all-electric flight is a momentous occasion. This is the highlight of my career and is an incredible achievement for the whole team. The opportunity to be at the forefront of another pioneering chapter of Rolls-Royce’s story as we look to deliver the future of aviation is what dreams are made of.”\nWhile all three organisations share a passionate pioneering spirit, Rolls-Royce through the development process has learnt from the motorsport background of both partners and in particular the pace of start-up Electroflight. Meanwhile we have shared expertise and technology with our partners including the rigorous safety and testing methods needed by the civil aviation industry –this combination has helped turn a concept into a world record breaker.\nDr Tim Woolmer, YASA’s Chief Technology Officer and Founder said, “Electric flight is set to be as transformative for mobility as thejet engine was 70 years ago. It’s thrilling to see our ultra-high performance, super-low weight electric motors powering the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ to these great speeds, and to know that collaborative projects like ACCEL take us one step closer to emissions-free electric flight becoming a commercial realityfor all.”\nThe ACCEL programme has also been supported by two further great British pioneers, Jaguar Land Rover who have loaned all-electric zero emission Jaguar I-PACE cars as towing and support vehicles and Bremont, the luxury watchmaker, who were the official timing partner for the record attempt. The aircraft took off from the MoD’s Boscombe Down site, which is managed by QinetiQ and flew profiles according to the FAI guidelines for record attempts in the Powered Aeroplane C-1C Electric class. Test Pilot, Electroflight Steve Jones flew the ‘Spirit of Innovation’ aircraft for the 15km and the time to climb to 3000 metres record runs that have been submitted.\nGary Elliott, CEO of the Aerospace Technology Institute, said: “The ACCEL project demonstrates that strategic investment in UK technology and innovation can achieve extraordinary world-beating results, and sets us firmly on the path to decarbonising passenger flight in the future. This achievement of Rolls-Royce, Electroflight and YASA will resonate for many years to come and inspire the next generation of aerospace engineers. They deserve their place in the record books, and the ATI is proud to have played our part in that. Congratulations to the whole team.”\nOur involvement in the ACCEL project is just one of the ways in which we are looking to make aviation more sustainable. In June, we announced our pathway to net zero carbon emissions – a year on from joining the UN Race to Zero campaign – committing to ensure our new products will be compatible with net zero operation by 2030 and all our products will be compatible with net zero by 2050.\n", "中文原文": "2021年11月19日我们相信我们的全电动“创新精神”飞机是世界上最快的全电动飞机，创造了三项新的世界纪录。我们已经向国际航空联合会(FAI)提交了数据，该联合会是控制和认证世界航空和航天记录的世界航空运动联合会，在2021年11月16日15:45（格林威治时间），该飞机在3公里以上达到555.9公里/小时（345.4英里/小时）的最高速度，将现有记录打破了213.04公里/小时（132英里/小时）。根据我们的数据，在英国国防部博斯科姆下降实验飞机试验场的进一步飞行中，这架飞机在15公里内达到了532.1公里/小时（330英里/小时）--比之前的记录快292.8公里/小时（182英里/小时）--并以202秒的时间打破了爬升至3000米的最快时间60秒。我们希望FAI将在不久的将来认证和正式确认团队的成就。在破纪录的运行中，飞机的最高速度达到了623公里/小时（387.4英里/小时），我们相信这使得“创新精神”成为世界上最快的全电动汽车。劳斯莱斯首席执行官沃伦·伊斯特（Warren East）表示：“对阿塞尔团队和劳斯莱斯来说，争夺全电动世界速度记录是一项了不起的成就。我要感谢我们的合作伙伴，特别是Electroflight在实现这一开创性突破方面的合作。为该项目开发的先进电池和推进技术在先进空中机动市场有着令人兴奋的应用。继世界关注第二十六届缔约方会议采取行动的必要性之后，这是另一个里程碑，将有助于使“零号喷气机”成为现实，并支持我们实现社会在空中、陆地和海上运输脱碳所需的技术突破的雄心。“商务部长夸西·夸滕说：“劳斯莱斯创新飞机的革命精神进一步证明了英国在创新方面令人羡慕的资历。这一记录将展示电动飞行的潜力，并有助于解开可能使其成为日常生活一部分的技术。政府自豪地支持这样的项目，以利用必要的私人投资来开发更清洁、更绿色的飞机，让人们像现在这样飞行，但以减少排放的方式。““创新精神”是ACCEL或“加速飞行电气化”项目的一部分。该项目一半的资金由航空航天技术研究所(ATI)与商业、能源和工业战略部和英国创新组织合作提供。这架飞机是由400千瓦(500+马力）的电动动力系统和航空航天中有史以来最大功率的推进电池组推动的，打破了纪录。我们与航空储能专家Electric Flight和汽车动力系统供应商YASA合作。作为一项惊人的技术成就，该项目和世界纪录的运行为我们未来的电力和推进系统提供了重要的数据，用于全电动城市空中机动和混合动力通勤飞机。例如，“空中出租车”对电池的要求与“创新精神”的发展非常相似。Stjohn Youngman,Electric Flight董事总经理。“我们很高兴在这个里程碑式的项目中发挥了不可或缺的作用。它的成功是对Electroflight团队和我们供应商的奉献和创新的恰当致敬。与经验丰富的项目合作伙伴合作开发推进和电池系统，产生了世界级的工程能力，将引领航空旅行的脱碳。我们的下一步是调整这项开创性的技术，以便它可以在更广泛的航空航天行业应用，以提供一种更可持续的飞行方式。“劳斯莱斯拥有令人难以置信的飞行速度记录尝试和打破记录的历史，可以追溯到20世纪30年代初的施耐德奖杯。试飞员兼劳斯莱斯飞行运营总监菲尔·奥德尔（Phill O'Dell)本着“创新精神”实现的速度超过了213.04公里/小时（132英里/小时），比西门子eAirline Powered Extra 330 LE特技飞机在2017年创下的纪录还要快。在FAI记录尝试的历史上，从来没有在如此短的时间内有如此显著的速度增长，突出了航空航天电气化的快速推进。菲尔·奥德尔说：“以如此不可思议的速度飞行‘创新精神'，并相信我们已经打破了全电动飞行的世界纪录，这是一个重要的时刻。这是我职业生涯的高光时刻，对全队来说都是不可思议的成就。当我们期待实现航空的未来时，有机会站在劳斯莱斯故事的另一个开创性篇章的最前沿，这就是梦想的来源。“而这三个组织都是", "中文源标题": "“创新精神”赌注宣称是世界上最快的全电动汽车", "英文整编": "Rollo's all-electric aircraft \"Innovation Spirit\" has reached a top speed of 623 km/h in its recent flight, making it the fastest all-electric aircraft in the world.The \"Spirit of Innovation\" has set three new world records, and Rolls-Royce has submitted data to the International Aviation Federation (FAI).

By gathering experience with prototypes and studying electric propulsion architectures at the aircraft level, Safran is positioning itself as the supplier of a full range of motors for all-electric and hybrid propulsion systems, from light aircraft to narrowbodies.\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency （EASA）is expected to certify the company’s 100-kW （135-shp）EngineUs 100 electric propulsion unit in 2023. “Then we will launch the EngineUs 500,” says Herve Blanc, manager of the power division at Toulouse-based Safran Electrical & Power.\nThe designation of Safran’s motors indicates cruise power; their maximum power is greater. The EngineUs 100 and EngineUs 500 have maximum powers of 150 kW and 750 kW, respectively.\nFor light aircraft, Safran plans to market an electric counterpart to the existing Lycoming product range in piston engines. “From the beginning, the EngineUs 100—the motor itself and its distribution and protection systems—was created as a Lycoming replacement,” Blanc says.\nThe company also envisions a family of more powerful motors that would be the equivalent of Pratt & Whitney’s PT6A turboprop series. For example, the appropriate size for a 19-seat regional aircraft is the EngineUs 500, he says.\nU.S.-based Bye Aerospace received its first EngineUs 100s early this year. The motor will power the two-seat eFlyer 2 electric trainer, which is planned to fly this year; FAA Part 23 certification is expected in 2023. Bye’s other two projects are the four-seat eFlyer 4 and the 8-12-seat eFlyer 800. “We are jointly working on their architecture,” Blanc says. “We are converging.”\nSafran, meanwhile, has accumulated flight hours with two EngineUs 45s on French startup VoltAero’s Cassio 1 testbed. The motors are part of a hybrid-electric propulsion system on the modified Cessna 337H Skymaster. “The Cassio 1 has flown in rainy and cold conditions,” he says.\nThe motors have now been removed from the aircraft and disassembled for analysis. Although no issue was encountered, the examination will provide useful feedback. Engineers can see whether parts such as bearings experience wear as predicted after 100-200 hr. of operation, Blanc adds.\nA key part of the work with VoltAero has been on control law settings. An electric motor has a much faster response than a conventional aircraft engine. That responsiveness has to be adjusted so that a pilot is not too surprised during operation, Blanc says.\nIn addition, Safran supplied motors for Bell’s electrically distributed anti-torque （EDAT）system. The EDAT testbed, which flew in 2019, was a modified Bell 429 with four fixed-pitch electric fans mounted in the vertical stabilizer, replacing the conventional tail rotor.\nAn unnamed Chinese electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing prototype uses Safran motors as well. In total, over the various platforms, Safran’s EngineUs motors have logged 1,000 flight hours, Blanc says.\nHaving both European and U.S. customers is proving useful, allowing Safran to work with both EASA and the FAA to define a certification template. “We contribute to aligning their approaches,” Blanc adds.\nEarly in April, Safran signed agreements with Toulouse-based Aura Aero, a light and regional aircraft manufacturer. Safran will supply the propulsion system for Aura’s Integral E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater is an evolution of the Integral R, an aerobatic-capable piston single.\nSafran was to deliver a 100-kW EngineUs electric motor this summer so that the Integral E could fly by year-end. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing the two pilots. As a result, Aura’s electric project will likely be delayed.\nSafran had also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to work jointly on the ERA 19-seater. The aircraft is targeted at regional air transport, and though it is ultimately intended to have a full-electric configuration, it will initially receive a hybrid system.\nAura and Safran will collaborate on defining both the propulsive and nonpropulsive electric system architectures. “We will work as an integrated team and study trade-offs until the end of the year,” Blanc says. “We will answer questions such as what is the right level of distribution for propulsion.”\nWith today’s batteries, at a specific energy of 200-300 Wh/kg, the ERA may incorporate a turbine engine as a range extender. This will run at a constant, optimal speed to feed the motors directly or charge batteries. “Typically, takeoff would be all-electric, and cruise would use the range extender before an all-electric landing,” Blanc says.\nAura is planning on a first flight of the ERA in 2024 and entry into service in 2027. Such an aggressive schedule is possible, according to Blanc. “Our motors, batteries and distribution systems will be ready,” he says.\nThe next generation of solid-state batteries, expected to be available between 2025 and 2030, will have a specific energy of 400-500 Wh/kg. They might enable a 19-seater to be an all-electric system or, at least, to make less use of the range extender, Blanc says. They may be suitable for upgrading the aircraft after 2027.\nSafran will integrate cells from specialist suppliers, which will be carefully chosen for aerospace use. “A battery is a complicated object,” Blanc says. “Offering a good specific energy is not enough. We want to know the power it can deliver depending on the number of cycles it has performed. A chemistry is credible when it has been tested for weeks with cycles representative of aviation.”\nIn the future, Safran and GE Aviation—its partner in the CFM International joint venture—may consider the introduction of electric motors in a hybrid turbofan. Coupled with sustainable aviation fuels, motors that boost a thermal engine might be an efficient formula to cut a narrowbody’s CO2 emissions.\n", "中文原文": "赛峰正在进行其在电力推进方面的总体计划，同时追求电动马达的认证，同时与初创公司airframers合作。通过收集原型机的经验和研究飞机级的电力推进结构，赛峰将自己定位为全电动和混合动力推进系统的全系列电机供应商，从轻型飞机到窄体。欧盟航空安全局(EASA)预计将于2023年认证该公司的100千瓦(135-shp)工程100电力推进装置。“然后我们将推出EngineUs 500，”总部位于图卢兹的赛峰电力公司电力部门经理埃尔夫·布兰克说。赛峰的电机的名称表示巡航功率；它们的最大功率更大。EngineUs 100和EngineUs 500的最大功率分别为150千瓦和750千瓦。对于轻型飞机，Safran计划在现有的Lycomming产品系列中销售一款电动活塞发动机。布兰克说：“从一开始，EngineUs 100--电机本身及其分配和保护系统--就是作为莱来姆的替代品而创建的。”该公司还设想了一系列更强大的发动机，将相当于普惠公司的PT6A涡轮螺旋桨系列。他说，例如，19座支线飞机的合适尺寸是EngineUs 500。总部位于美国的Bye Aerospace今年早些时候收到了第一台Engineus 100。该电机将为双座eFlyer 2电动教练机提供动力，计划今年飞行；美国联邦航空局第23部分认证预计在2023年。Bye的另外两个项目是四座的eFlyer4和8-12座的eFlyer800。“我们正在共同致力于他们的架构，”布兰克说。“我们正在趋同。”与此同时，赛峰在法国初创公司伏尔泰罗的卡西奥1号测试床上积累了两架Engineus 45的飞行小时。发动机是改装的塞斯纳337H Skymaster上的混合电力推进系统的一部分。“卡西奥1号在下雨和寒冷的条件下飞行，”他说。发动机现在已经从飞机上移除，并被拆开进行分析。虽然没有遇到任何问题，但审查将提供有用的反馈。布兰克补充说，工程师可以看到轴承等部件在运行100-200小时后是否经历了预测的磨损。与Voltero合作的一个关键部分是控制律设置。电动机的响应比传统的飞机发动机快得多。布兰克说，这种反应必须进行调整，以便飞行员在操作过程中不会太惊讶。此外，赛峰还为贝尔的电动分布式反扭矩(EDAT)系统提供电机。2019年飞行的EDAT测试床是一种改进的贝尔429，在垂直稳定器上安装了四个固定螺距的电风扇，取代了传统的尾桨。一款未透露姓名的中国电动垂直起降样机也使用了赛峰汽车。布兰克说，在各种平台上，赛峰的EngineUs motors总共记录了1000个飞行小时。事实证明，拥有欧洲和美国的客户是有用的，这使得赛峰能够与EASA和FAA合作来定义认证模板。“我们有助于调整他们的方法，”布兰克补充道。4月初，赛峰与总部位于图卢兹的轻型和支线飞机制造商Aura Aero签署了协议。赛峰将为Aura的整体E飞行验证机提供推进系统。电动双座是一个整体R的演变，一个特技能力活塞单。赛峰将在今年夏天交付一台100千瓦的EngineUs电动机，这样Integral E就可以在年底前飞行。不幸的是，Integral R原型机于4月12日坠毁，两名飞行员遇难。因此，Aura的电力项目可能会被推迟。赛峰还与Aura签署了一份谅解备忘录，合作开发19座的ERA。该飞机的目标是区域航空运输，虽然它最终打算有一个全电动配置，但它最初将接受一个混合系统。Aura和Safran将合作定义推进式和非推进式电力系统架构。“我们将作为一个综合团队工作，研究权衡，直到年底，”布兰克说。“我们将回答推进的正确分配水平等问题。”今天的电池，在特定能量为200-300瓦时/千克时，电子逆向拍卖可能会合并涡轮发动机作为增程器。这将运行在一个恒定的，最佳的速度，直接给电机或充电电池。布兰克说：“通常情况下，起飞将是全电动的，巡航将在全电动着陆前使用航程扩展器。”Aura计划在2024年进行ERA的首次飞行，并在2027年投入服务。根据布兰克的说法，这样一个积极的时间表是可能的。“我们的电机、电池和配电系统将准备就绪，”他说。下一代o", "中文源标题": "赛峰霍恩斯电力推进战略", "英文整编": "Safran is pushing ahead with its electric propulsion master plan and is also seeking motor certification while working with start-up aircraft manufacturers. By accumulating prototype experience and studying the electric propulsion architecture at the aircraft level, Safran has positioned itself as a full range of motor suppliers for all-electric and hybrid electric propulsion systems from light aircraft to narrow-body aircraft.Safran's 100kW (135hp) EngineUs 100 motor is expected to be certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2023. After that, Safran will launch EngineUs 500.The name of Safran motor indicates the power in cruising state. The maximum power of EngineUs 100 and EngineUs 500 is 150 kW and 750 kW respectively.For light aircraft, Safran plans to introduce an electric product corresponding to the existing Laikangming piston engine product line. From the outset, the engine us 100 motor itself and its distribution and protection systems were designed as an alternative to Lacumine.Safran also envisions a series of more powerful electric motors, equivalent to Pratt & Whitney's PT6A turboprop engine series. EngineUs 500 for 19-seat regional aircraft.Bye Aerospace, based in the United States, received the first batch of EngineUs 100 in early 2022. The motor will serve as the power of its two-seat eFlyer 2 electric trainer and is scheduled to make its first flight in 2022; FAA Part 23 certification is expected in 2023. Bye's other two projects are the 4-seat eFlyer 4 and the 8-12-seat eFlyer 800.At the same time, Safran Group has carried out flight tests using two EngineUs 45 motors on the Cassio 1 flight test bench of French start-up VoltAero, and has completed the tests in rainy and cold environment. The motor has now been removed from the plane and disassembly analysis has been carried out. Engineers can see whether the expected wear of bearings and other components will occur after 100-200 hours of operation. A key part of VoltAero's work is the control law setup. The response speed of electric motor is much faster than that of traditional aircraft engine, so this response ability must be adjusted to help pilots get used to operation. EngineUs 45 is part of the improved Cessna 337H \"Air Overlord\" hybrid electric propulsion system.In addition, Safran also provides motors for Bell's Distributed Electric Anti-Torque (EDAT) system. The EDAT test bed that first flew in 2019 is a modified Bell 429, which is equipped with four fixed-pitch electric fans on the vertical stabilizer, replacing the traditional tail rotor.Safran motors are also used in an unnamed Chinese electric VTOL prototype. Overall, Safran's EngineUs motors have accumulated 1,000 flight hours on various platforms.Having customers in both Europe and the United States has proved very useful, and Safran can work with EASA and FAA to develop certification templates.In early April, Safran Group signed an agreement with Toulouse's light regional aircraft manufacturer Aura Aero. Safran will provide propulsion systems for Aura's Integrated E flight demonstrator. The electric two-seater aircraft is an evolution of the Integrated R, a single-engine piston aircraft capable of aerobatics.Safran will deliver a 100kW EngineUs motor in the summer of 2022 so that the Integrated E can fly before the end of the year. Unfortunately, the Integral R prototype crashed on April 12, killing two pilots. As a result, Aura's electricity project could be delayed.Safran also signed a memorandum of understanding with Aura to jointly develop the 19-seat regional aircraft ERA. The target of this aircraft is regional air transportation. In the initial stage, it adopts hybrid electric propulsion system, and finally it will adopt all-electric propulsion. Aura and Safran will work together to define propulsion and non-propulsion power system architectures.With the specific energy of 200 ~ 300Wh/kg of existing batteries, ERA may use turbine engine as range extender. The turbine engine runs at a constant optimum speed to directly drive the motor or charge the battery. Usually take-off and landing will be all-electric, and range extender, that is, turbine engine, will be used in cruise phase.Aura is scheduled to make the first flight of ERA in 2024 and be put into use in 2027.The next generation of solid-state batteries is expected to be launched from 2025 to 2030, with a specific energy of 400 ~ 500Wh/kg. This could see 19-seater aircraft adopt an all-electric propulsion system, or at least reduce the use of range extenders, which could be suitable for aircraft upgraded after 2027. Safran will integrate batteries from professional battery suppliers and verify battery performance through several aviation cycles of testing.In the future, Safran and GE may consider introducing electric motors into hybrid turbofan engines. Together with sustainable aviation fuel, it may be an effective way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of narrow-body aircraft."}, {"中文标题": "法德企业签订返还放射性废物的合同", "情报来源": "世界核新闻网站", "时间": "2021年8月20日", "整编内容": "法国欧安诺集团（Orano）表示，已与德国4家电力公司签署合同，将这些公司留在阿格后处理厂的所有放射性废物归还给他们。这些总价值超过10亿欧元（12亿美元）的合同生效取决于德、法两国政府的正式协议。1977年至1991年之间，德国4家电力公司签订了乏燃料后处理合同。根据合同，法国阿格后处理厂处理了5310吨德国电力公司的乏燃料。这些乏燃料的后处理工作已于2008年完成。根据双方的承诺，1996年至2011年期间，99%以上的法国处理德国乏燃料后产生的高放废物已运回德国。然而，长寿期的中放废物（ILW）仍有待归还。Orano表示，这些新合同将使其能够完全履行此前对德国电力公司乏燃料进行后处理时作出的所有承诺。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中核战略规划研究总院", "源网址": "https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Orano-signs-contracts-for-return-of-German-waste", "源标题": "Orano signs contracts for return of German waste", "原文": "World Nuclear News 20 August 2021\nFrance's Orano said it has signed contracts with German utilities EnBW, PreussenElektra, RWE and Vattenfall for the return of all the German nuclear waste remaining at its La Hague reprocessing plant.

Under the contracts, 5310 metric tonnes of fuel were processed at the La Hague plant.\nThe recycling of German used nuclear fuel at La Hague was completed in 2008. The inter-governmental agreement governing those operations included a provision that the equivalent in mass and radioactivity of the waste contained in the used fuel elements must be returned to Germany, with shipments of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to be completed by 2011 and the return of long-lived intermediate-level waste (ILW) no later than 2024.

Laura Kelly announced Thursday that Kansas has an agreement with Integra Technologies, based in Wichita, for a 10-year package of tax breaks and reimbursement of expenses. State officials said the new, $1.8 billion plant would cover 1 million square feet, have 2,000 employees and create 3,000 additional jobs among suppliers and other local businesses.\nThe announcement comes with the U.S. trying to reverse a loss of capacity for making the chips that are vital to smartphones, laptops and other modern-day conveniences, as well as automobiles and life-saving medical devices. Congress last year approved a measure that provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry.\nKelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that the state's incentives are crucial to attracting the federal funds and \"making Kansas an essential part of our country's national security efforts.\"\n\"This advanced manufacturing facility is part of a national push to restore our semiconductor industry so that U.S. workers and businesses can compete and win in the race for the 21st Century,\" Kelly said.\nIntegra CEO Brett Robinson would not say how much federal funding the company needs, only that there is \"no commercially viable way\" to do the project without it. He and state officials said other states were trying to attract the project, though they did not disclose the competitors.\n\"It's not just critical to the United States and to security, but it's critical to the supply chain,\" said Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican.\nPresident Joe Biden pushed Congress last year to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, because of a shortage of chips made worse by the global coronavirus pandemic and concerns about competing with international rivals, particularly China. There's been a decades-long shift to cheaper-to-operate Asian chip plants, and the industry is now dependent on Taiwan, which China has long claimed as its own.\n\"If we were ever to lose, for a sustainable amount of time, access to the southeast Asian supply chain, what we just went through would pale in comparison,\" Robinson said.\nIntegra, founded in 1983, has about 500 employees in Wichita and Silicon Valley and describes itself as the largest U.S. provider of the last two major assembly and testing steps in the chip manufacturing process. The new factory is expected to pay an average annual wage of $51,000, about 46% higher than the state's average of roughly $35,000.\nFor Integra to receive its incentives, it must invest at least $1.5 billion in the new factory in the next five years and consistently provide the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs for 10 consecutive years.\nThe incentives are part of a program Kansas created last year to ramp up its efforts to compete with other states for new, large factories. Under that program, the state was allowed to offer up to $1 billion in incentives to a single company each in 2022 and 2023.\nIn July 2022, Kelly and other state officials announced that Panasonic Corp. plans to build a mega-factory to produce electric vehicle batteries for Tesla and other carmakers. The state lured the Japanese electronics giant's project to the edge of the Kansas City area with incentives worth $829 million over 10 years, the most the state has ever offered.\nThe law allowing the incentives required top leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature to sign off any deal between a company and the state Department of Commerce, which is led by Lt. Gov. David Toland, a Democrat like Kelly. The legislative leaders gave their approval just minutes ahead of the announcement, after meeting in private with Kelly for half an hour to review the agreement, with no opportunity for public review or input.\nThe law also requires Kansas to drop its corporate income tax rates by half a percentage point for each mega-deal. If the Integra project goes forward, the top rate would decline to 6% from 7%, saving all corporations roughly $100 million a year.\nWhile both mega-projects have had bipartisan support, some lawmakers are critical of promising such big taxpayer-funded incentives to a single firm.\n\"We have not written the checks for this first project and they're starting the second one without even knowing that it works,\" state Senate tax committee Chair Caryn Tyson, a conservative Republican from eastern Kansas, said before Thursday's announcement.\n", "中文原文": "堪萨斯州计划向其最大城市的一家半导体公司提供3.04亿美元的纳税人资助激励措施，以建设一个巨大的新工厂，但如果没有美国政府承诺的重建国家芯片制造能力的资金，该项目将无法推进。州长劳拉·凯利（Laura Kelly）周四宣布，堪萨斯州与总部位于威奇托的Integra Technologies达成了一项为期10年的税收减免和费用报销一揽子协议。州官员表示，这座耗资18亿美元的新工厂将占地100万平方英尺，有2000名员工，并为供应商和其他当地企业创造3000个额外就业机会。这一声明发布之际，美国正试图扭转制造芯片的能力损失，这些芯片对智能手机、笔记本电脑和其他现代便利设施以及汽车和救生医疗设备至关重要。国会去年批准了一项措施，为半导体行业提供超过520亿美元的赠款和其他激励措施。凯利在州议会新闻发布会上告诉记者，该州的激励措施对吸引联邦资金和“使堪萨斯州成为我国国家安全努力的重要组成部分”至关重要。凯利说：“这个先进的制造设施是国家努力恢复我们的半导体行业的一部分，这样美国工人和企业就可以在21世纪的竞争中竞争并获胜。”Integra首席执行官布雷特·罗宾逊（Brett Robinson）不愿透露该公司需要多少联邦资金，只表示没有联邦资金，就没有“商业上可行的方法”来完成该项目。他和州官员表示，其他州正在试图吸引该项目，但他们没有透露竞争对手。威奇托地区共和党人、堪萨斯州参议院议长泰·马斯特森（Ty Masterson）表示：“这不仅对美国和安全至关重要，对供应链也至关重要。”乔·拜登（Joe Biden）总统去年推动国会提振美国半导体行业，因为全球新冠肺炎疫情加剧了芯片短缺，并担心与国际竞争对手，特别是中国竞争。几十年来，亚洲芯片厂已经转向运营成本更低的工厂，该行业现在依赖台湾，中国长期以来一直声称台湾是自己的。罗宾逊说：“如果我们在可持续的时间内失去进入东南亚供应链的机会，与之相比，我们刚刚经历的一切将相形见绌。”Integra成立于1983年，在威奇托和硅谷拥有约500名员工，自称是芯片制造过程中最后两个主要组装和测试步骤的美国最大供应商。新工厂预计将支付平均年薪5.1万美元，比该州约3.5万美元的平均工资高出约46%。Integra要想获得激励措施，必须在未来五年内向新工厂投资至少15亿美元，并连续10年提供相当于1600个全职工作岗位的服务。这些激励措施是堪萨斯州去年创建的一项计划的一部分，该计划旨在加大与其他州竞争新的大型工厂的力度。根据该计划，该州被允许在2022年和2023年各向一家公司提供高达10亿美元的激励措施。2022年7月，凯利和其他州官员宣布，松下公司计划建造一家巨型工厂，为特斯拉和其他汽车制造商生产电动汽车电池。该州在10年内以价值8.29亿美元的激励措施将这家日本电子巨头的项目吸引到堪萨斯城地区的边缘，这是该州有史以来提供的最多激励措施。允许激励措施的法律要求共和党控制的立法机构的最高领导人签署公司和州商务部之间的任何协议，州商务部由副州长大卫·托兰（David Toland）领导，他是像凯利一样的民主党人。立法领导人在宣布前几分钟批准了协议，此前他们与凯利私下会面了半个小时，审查了协议，没有公开审查或投入的机会。该法律还要求堪萨斯州将每笔大型交易的公司所得税税率降低0.5个百分点。如果Integra项目继续下去，最高利率将从7%下降到6%，每年为所有公司节省大约1亿美元。虽然这两个大型项目都得到了两党的支持，但一些立法者对承诺向一家公司提供如此大的纳税人资助激励措施持批评态度。堪萨斯州东部的保守派共和党人、州参议院税收委员会主席卡琳·泰森（Caryn Tyson）在周四宣布之前表示：“我们还没有为第一个项目开出支票，他们甚至不知道它是否有效就开始了第二个项目。”", "中文源标题": "堪萨斯州承诺向芯片厂投资3.04亿美元以吸引联邦资金", "英文整编": "Recently, Kansas promised to invest 3. 5% in chip factories. 0.4 billion dollars to attract federal funds to build a new factory.

However, a major challenge is making a scalable, integrated platform to deploy and commercialize.\nOne of the drawbacks of quantum photonics is that small interfaces and quantum effects could distort data signals and make them unusable. Because they use light instead of electrons, quantum applications also require new technologies for filtering, amplifying, and conditioning optical signals.\nResearchers at the University of Twente recently developed a new technique to confine sound and light waves in a multilayer silicon nitride waveguide. Their solution can alter optical signals with sound in large-scale integrated circuits. The device is also compatible with current production methods. \nStimulated Brillouin Scattering\nProcessing, amplifying, and filtering optical signals are at the heart of quantum photonics. One method to do this effectively is a coherent optomechanical interaction technique called stimulated Brillouin scattering. Brillouin scattering occurs when optical waves interact with acoustic lattice vibrations or phonons.\nWhen a photon interacts with a substance, energy transfers to acoustic phonons. The incident photon scatters to slightly lower energy and propagates in the opposite direction. This scattering of photons by acoustic phonons is called Brillouin scattering.\nMaximum scattering occurs when the reflected light overlaps in phase with sound waves. Therefore, the scattering is highly frequency selective, and the reflected wave reduces in frequency by about 1–15 GHz due to the Doppler shift. This effect plays an important role in optical amplifiers and filters.\nThis scattering is achieved by using two finely-tuned lasers to generate a soundwave and trap it in a waveguide. Light passing through the waveguide interacts with the soundwave and undergoes scattering and Doppler shift, effectively filtering the signal.\nFor such applications, silicon nitride waveguides are preferred due to their nonlinear refractive index and CMOS compatibility.\nSilicon Nitride Waveguides\nSilicon nitride waveguides are a non-linear high refractive index and low-loss semiconductor, which is advantageous for various non-linear optical applications. The waveguides consist of a bottom reflector stacked on a silicon nitride platform and clad with an oxide buffer layer underneath. These layers are fabricated with an LCVD (laser chemical vapor deposition) device and can be patterned to a specific shape, making it CMOS-compatible.\nThe high refractive index of the dielectric material allows high optical confinement and control over dispersion with the waveguide structure. Despite better mode confinement, silicon nitride is less expensive than its counterparts. Therefore, this material has emerged as a workhorse for nonlinear optics in recent years.\nPrevious studies have suggested that implementing stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon nitride can unlock promising new technologies like on-chip amplifiers and lasers. However, the demonstration is usually plagued by acoustic leakage from the silicon nitride core and the oxide cladding. This effect prevents strong Brillouin interactions and makes these waveguides ineffective for trapping sound waves.\nTrapping Sound and Light with Multilayer Silicon Nitride Waveguides\nResearchers at the University of Twente used low-loss multilayer silicon nitride nano-photonic circuits consisting of 50 cm-long spiral waveguides to confine optical and sound waves.

In the research, the researchers used a low-loss multilayer silicon nitride nano-photonic circuit chip composed of a 50 cm long spiral waveguide to limit light waves and sound waves. This arrangement prevented sound leakage in a single silicon nitride chip, thus accurately controlling the separation between silicon nitride layers, changing the sound wave guide and suppressing the scattering of sound waves in the waveguide. Because multilayer silicon nitride waveguides can realize circuit-level stimulated Brillouin scattering, researchers have also created a new concept for verification of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, using notch filters with only 0. The increase of 4 decibels is beneficial, and the high inhibition of 66 decibels is achieved.

A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build up to 10 SMRs by 2035.\nThe MoU was signed at the Nuclear Industry Association's Nuclear2021 conference in London last week. It follows the creation of Rolls-Royce SMR Ltd, which has been established to bring forward and deliver the next generation of low-cost, low-carbon nuclear power technology.\nRolls-Royce said the project \"directly supports the UK's civil nuclear renaissance and the development of SMRs in the UK, with Sheffield Forgemasters able to supply the complex, nuclear-grade demonstrator forgings as part of the regulatory process.\"\n\"Sheffield Forgemasters are world leaders in complex, safety-critical forgings and castings and we are incredibly fortunate to have their experience to support and enable our SMR programme,\" said Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson. \"This agreement is the start of an enduring partnership and reflects our commitment to the UK supply chain as we look to re-build and re-energise the vital UK nuclear supply chain.\"\nSheffield Forgemasters CEO David Bond added: \"SMRs have the potential to become the standard for civil nuclear power generation and, as an emerging market, fit extremely well with our long track record of supplying nuclear power components into the UK submarine programme.\n\"With a new investment fund of GBP400 million (USD530 million) to replace our defence critical assets, including the provision of a new 13,000 tonne forging line and 19 state-of-the-art machining centres, we will create much higher levels of manufacturing capability and efficiency, to the benefit of defence nuclear work, but with obvious cross-benefits for civil nuclear activity, including SMRs.\n\"Rolls-Royce is advancing plans for factory assembled SMRs in the UK and Sheffield Forgemasters is well positioned to be a UK supply chain partner in the delivery of complex, finished and semi-finished nuclear-grade components into the SMR build programme.\"\nAccording to Rolls-Royce, when fully operational the Rolls-Royce SMR programme will create 40,000 UK jobs primarily across the North and Midlands, where the majority of UK nuclear expertise is located, with the potential for GBP52 billion in economic benefits from export.\nLast month, Rolls-Royce SMR issued a Notice of Intention to submit its 470 MWe SMR design for entry to the UK's Generic Design Assessment (GDA) regulatory process. The review of the SMR design - based on a small pressurised water reactor - will formally begin once the government has assessed the company's capability and capacity to successfully enter the GDA process.\nA Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium - which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI - aims to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.\nTo minimise the construction phase of the programme, the UK SMR is fully modularised to enable the plant to be transported by road, rail or sea. Targeting a 500-day modular build, the consortium says this concept minimises the onsite time and effort required to construct and build the plant. About 80% of the plant's components will be sourced from the UK. The target cost for each station is GBP1.8 billion by the time five have been built, with further savings possible.

It has received a three-year funding package totalling ?1.5M from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\nPrincipal InvestigatorDr Alborz Shokrani, a Senior Lecturer in Bath’sDepartment of Mechanical Engineeringand a member of theAdvanced Design and Manufacturing Centre, says that new cutting-specific sensing technology is needed to achieve greater accuracy and deal with new manufacturing challenges, particularly in the aerospace and automotive industries.\nThe researchers say that currently, as much as 4% of aerospace manufacturing costs are spent on replacing cutting tools early, despite only 50-80% of a cutting tool’s life being effectively used. With a global market size of over $34bn for cutting tools, this wastage represents a huge opportunity for savings and improving the sustainability of machining.\nDr Shokrani says: “It’s has become received wisdom in industry that to machine a part like a landing gear for an aeroplane, you need a large, incredibly stiff machine to achieve the necessary precision, but the consequence of this is that machining costs grow exponentially in line with greater precision. This has resulted in the need for expensive and non-value adding verification and error compensation methods – which do not consider tool geometry, cutting forces and time-variable errors.\n“The idea of sensors in cutting tools is not new but these sensor embedded tools lack the sophisticated data analysis amd decision-making capability that they truly require. They rely on technologies which are not tailored for cutting and are not integrated into the machining control system.”\nProject co-investigatorDr Ali Mohammadi, from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, adds: “Existing high precision sensors are either too large or too costly to be useful outside of laboratory applications, and off-the-shelf sensors and data transmission devices are not necessarily suitable for monitoring or controlling machining processes. We aim to create a series of sensors specifically for machining that will help manufacturers improve quality without facing major cost implications.”\nDr Shokrani explains that additive manufacturing (3D printing) also created new challenges for cutting tools: “3D printing has helped us create more optimised parts with complex geometries, but these can require bespoke finishing with long slender tools. In these cases, cutting forces can bend the tool and the workpiece, resulting in undesired vibrations and geometrical inaccuracies. In turn, this damages surface integrity and shortens the life of tools. Better sensors and intelligent control systems could bring major benefits to all kinds of precision cutting applications.”\nResearchers from Bath will work alongside colleagues from the Universities of Nottingham and Sheffield during the project.

The AD series reactors, designed by OKBM, are water-cooled uranium-graphite thermal neutron reactors.\nA total of five industrial uranium-graphite reactors operated at SCC: I-1, EI-2, ADE-3, ADE-4, ADE-5. They were intended for the production of plutonium with ADE-4, ADE-5 also producing production of thermal and electrical energy. The decommissioning of EI-2 was formally accepted as completed by a government commission in 2015 - the first ever decommissioning of a commercial uranium-graphite reactor. To guarantee safe storage of the reactor for tens of thousands of years, SCC in 2010 established UDC UGR, which, in co-operation with leading research centres of the Russian Academy of Sciences, developed a unique decommissioning technology whereby all reactor cavities were filled with a mix of natural clays.\nEI-2 began operating in February 1958 at the Tomsk-7 closed city (now Seversk). It was SCC's second industrial uranium-graphite reactor. The first (I-1) was launched in 1955 and together they formed the first dual-purpose NPP producing both weapons-grade plutonium and 100MWe of electricity. In the 1960s SCC put three more dual-purpose reactors into operation - ADE-3 (1961), ADE-4 (1964) and ADE-5 (1965) boosting power production to 600 MWe. These were designed by the NN Dollezhal Research & Development Institute of Power Engineering (Nikiet).\nUnder a Russian-US agreement to end production of military-grade plutonium, I-1 was closed in 1990, EI-2 in 1991 and ADE-3 in 1992. ADE 4 and ADE 5 continued operating until 2008 as they also provided power to the site. After the decommissioning of EI-2 in 2015, it was expected that the withdrawal of the remaining four shutdown reactors at SCC would take about five years but this was extended by a year and in 2021, Rosatom signed a state contract with UDC UGR, which was tasked with dismantling and fragmentation of radiation-contaminated equipment and pipelines, as well as concreting of the ADE-5 sub-reactor space. The work was expected to take two years.\nIn the course of the work, some 1,500 tons of equipment and pipelines of the first and second circuits of the ADE-4 and ADE-5 reactors were dismantled and fragmented, which, according to the results of radiation measurements, were classified as radioactive waste. They were fragmented, packaged in containers and placed on a specially prepared temporary storage site. Part of the dismantled pipelines was deactivated and returned to the national economy as scrap metal.\nThe need to carry out work on the dismantling and movement of large-tonnage equipment under cramped conditions when exposed to radiation exposure significantly complicated the work.” explained Egor Paderin, head of the decommissioning service of nuclear installations.\nA lot of preparatory work was carried out to concrete the sub-reactor space of the ADE-5 reactor mine: access roads for concrete trucks and concrete pump installation sites were organised, walkways and open-air openings were made in the walls and inter-story floors. During preparation of the premises for concreting, 107 tons of equipment and metal structures, about eight tons of plastic and more than two tons of electric cable were dismantled. All generated waste was fragmented, packaged in containers and placed on the special site. When concreting the reactor mine, heavy concrete with a waterproofing additive was used. In total, more than 2,500 cubic metres of concrete was required for the bottom of the reactor mine\nAll work under the state contract was completed in full and on time for a total cost of RUB412m ($6m). The work was carried as part of the project “Decommissioning of industrial uranium-graphite reactors ADE-4 and ADE-5 using the ‘on-site burial’ option developed by the All-Russia Science Research and Design Institute of Power Engineering Technology (VNIPIET).\nAs well as the three uranium graphite reactors built at SCC, three others were constructed at the Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) in Zheleznogorsk (Krasnoyarsk). The first AD reactor was launched in 1958 at MCC, solely for plutonium production. The second, ADE-1, launched in 1961, was intended also to produce electricity (hence the “E” for energy in its name) but never did so as the combined heat and power plant (CHPP) had not been completed. ADE-2 began operation in December 1963 after the CHPP was in place. All three reactors were built underground and used cooling water from the Yenisei River.\nIt was a huge undertaking. Some 27,000 prisoners worked on the construction of underground reactors. The volume of rock removed was several million cubic metres. More than 1 million cubic metres of concrete were laid, and tens of thousands of tons of metal structures, pipelines, cables were put in place. In the underground rooms, giant fans were installed with a capacity of about 1m cubic metres of air per hour. In 1992, the AD and ADE-1 reactors at MCC were shut down. MCC is investigating possible methods for decommissioning AD and ADE-1, Following public hearings in 2013 MCC said it favoured burying them on site as the mountain under which they were built forms a natural safety barrier.\nADE-2 was the last of Russia’s dual purpose plutonium production reactors to be closed. It was shut down in 2010, after producing weapons-grade plutonium for nearly 52 years, in line with a 1997 Plutonium Production Reactor Agreement with the US. It also provided heat and electricity to Zheleznogorsk and nearby areas, which was its main function after1993. It continued to produce weapons-grade plutonium as a by-product, but under the terms of the US agreement, this could not be used for weapons purposes and was stockpiled.\nADE-2 in 2021 became a nuclear industry museum, joining the world's first nuclear icebreaker Lenin and the Obninsk NPP, the world's first civil nuclear power plant.\n", "中文原文": "2023年1月13日打印电子邮件俄罗斯铀-石墨核反应堆退役实验示范中心（UDC UGR,国家核工业公司Rosatom的一部分）已经完成了位于塞夫斯克西伯利亚化学联合企业(SCC)的工业反应堆ADE-4和ADE-5的技术设备和管道的拆除和碎片化工作。AD系列反应堆是由OKBM设计的水冷铀-石墨热中子反应堆。共有五个工业铀-石墨反应堆在SCC运行:I-1、EI-2、ADE-3、ADE-4、ADE-5。它们的目的是生产钚，ADE-4、ADE-5还生产热能和电能。EI-2的退役于2015年被一个政府委员会正式接受为完成--这是商业铀石墨反应堆的首次退役。为了保证反应堆安全储存数万年，SCC于2010年成立了UDC UGR，该公司与俄罗斯科学院的主要研究中心合作，开发了一种独特的退役技术，所有反应堆腔体都用天然粘土混合填充。EI-2于1958年2月在Tomsk-7封闭城市（现在的塞夫斯克）开始运行。这是SCC的第二个工业铀-石墨反应堆。第一个(I-1)于1955年发射，它们一起组成了第一个两用核电厂，生产武器级钚和100MWe的电力。在20世纪60年代，SCC又投入了三个两用反应堆--ADE-3(1961)、ADE-4(1964)和ADE-5(1965)将功率生产提高到600兆瓦。这些是由NN Dollezhal动力工程研究与发展研究所（Nikiet）设计的。根据俄美终止军用级钚生产的协议，I-1于1990年关闭，EI-2于1991年关闭，ADE-3于1992年关闭。ADE4和ADE5一直运行到2008年，因为它们也为现场提供电力。2015年EI-2退役后，预计SCC剩余四个关闭反应堆的退出将需要大约五年时间，但这一时间延长了一年，2021年，Rosatom与UDC UGR签署了一份国家合同，其任务是拆除和分割受辐射污染的设备和管道，以及为ADE-5子反应堆空间浇筑混凝土。这项工作预计需要两年时间。在工作过程中，ADE-4和ADE-5反应堆第一和第二回路的大约1500吨设备和管道被拆除和破碎，根据辐射测量结果，这些设备和管道被归类为放射性废物。它们被分割成碎片，装在集装箱里，放在一个特别准备的临时储存场地上。部分被拆除的管道被停用，并作为废金属返回国民经济。在受到辐射照射的情况下，需要在狭窄的条件下进行大吨位设备的拆除和移动工作，这使工作变得非常复杂。“核设施退役服务负责人埃戈尔·帕德林解释说。为将ADE-5反应堆矿的子反应堆空间混凝土化进行了大量准备工作：为混凝土卡车和混凝土泵安装场地组织了通道，在墙壁和层间楼层中设置了走道和露天开口。在准备房地浇筑混凝土期间，拆除了107吨设备和金属结构、约8吨塑料和两吨多电缆。所有产生的废物都被碎片化，用容器包装，放在特殊的场地上。在给反应堆矿井浇筑混凝土时，使用了带有防水添加剂的重混凝土。反应堆地雷底部总共需要2500多立方米混凝土国家合同下的所有工作都按时全面完成，总费用为4.12亿卢比（600万美元）。这项工作是作为“使用全俄电力工程技术科学研究设计院(VNIPIET)开发的‘现场掩埋’选项退役工业铀石墨反应堆ADE-4和ADE-5”项目的一部分进行的。除了在SCC建造的三个铀石墨反应堆外，在热列兹诺戈尔斯克（克拉斯诺亚尔斯克）的采矿和化学联合企业(MCC)还建造了另外三个反应堆。第一个AD反应堆于1958年在中冶公司发射，专门用于钚生产。第二个，ADE-1于1961年发射，也是为了发电（因此其名称中的“E”代表能源），但从未这样做，因为联合热电厂(CHPP)尚未完成。ADE-2在CHPP到位后于1963年12月开始运作。这三个反应堆都建在地下，使用叶尼塞河的冷却水。这是一项巨大的事业。大约27000名囚犯从事地下反应堆的建设。移除的岩石体积达数百万立方米。超过1米", "中文源标题": "俄罗斯拆除两座铀石墨反应堆", "英文整编": "Russia's National Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom) recently completed the dismantling of two military plutonium production reactors ADE-4 and ADE-5.

Dubbed a \"shadow waveguide,\" the technique uses only two sound sources to create a tightly confined, spatially complex acoustic field inside a chamber without requiring any interior structure. The technology offers a new suite of features to the fast-developing platform of acoustic tweezers that has applications in fields such as chemical reaction control, micro-robotics, drug delivery, and cell and tissue engineering.\nThe research appears online August 18 in the journal Science Advances.\nAcoustic tweezers are an emerging technology that uses sound waves to manipulate small particles suspended in liquid. Because no physical object is touching the particles, the technique is gentle, offers no biocompatibility issues and requires no labels, making it an enticing choice for working with delicate biomolecules.\nIn the biomedical realm, acoustic tweezers can trap, rotate and move particles or organisms for inspection, sorting or other applications. They can keep certain reagents and chemicals separated before allowing them to mix in precise amounts to control reactions. The technology also provides an avenue for patterning different materials before using any number of techniques to fix them in place to create new types of materials.\nDespite all of its potential, the technology does have its limitations. Most current setups use multiple sound sources placed around a liquid-filled chamber that creates a checkerboard pattern of areas that can trap and move particles in lockstep with one another. This makes it difficult to manipulate particles independently of one another or through complex patterns. The latter can be achieved by including solid channel structures within the chamber, but this can damage delicate particles and limit how quickly samples can be moved through the system.\nTo overcome these limitations, Steve Cummer, the William H. Younger Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Duke, turned to ideas inspired by metamaterials. Metamaterials are synthetic materials composed of many individual engineered features, which together produce properties not found in nature.\n\"We wanted to inject acoustic wave energy into the chamber and use a structure just outside of the chamber to control the shape of the sound waves inside,\" said Cummer. \"The result is sort of like an optical fiber for sound that shapes the sound propagation and intentionally leaks some of its energy into the chamber—a sort of sound shadow—to control the particles inside with virtual channels.\"\nIn the new paper, Cummer and Junfei Li, a postdoctoral researcher working in his lab, in collaboration with longtime acoustic tweezer innovator Tony Huang, the William Bevan Distinguished Professor of Engineering at Duke, demonstrate various capabilities of their shadow waveguide approach. Each shadow waveguide is created by 3D printing a mold with features specific to how particles inside the chamber are to be controlled. A type of silicone called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is poured into each half-tube mold with features that create channels within the finished product.\nThe PDMS has acoustic properties very similar to water, which allows sound waves to easily travel from the shadow waveguide into the chamber. The pattern of the air-filled channels within the PDMS dictates where and how the sound waves enter the chamber, allowing the researchers to create a wide range of complex acoustic fields to control particles.\nCummer and Li use this setup to trap and move individual microparticles along multiple complex paths through the chamber. And by setting up two sound sources—one at either end of the shadow waveguide—the researchers show they can pump particles along a slowly bending arc with precisely controlled speed.\nWith this demonstration in hand, the researchers are now looking to add complexity to their invention, either by making the waveguides dynamically reconfigurable or by merging it with other existing approaches to acoustic tweezers.\n\"Acoustic devices are very difficult to make reconfigurable, but we would love to figure out a way to make that possible because it would be a dramatic improvement in this technique's usability,\" said Li. \"For now, we're looking for specific challenges that we could adapt these shadow waveguides to address to move it from a proof-of-concept demonstration to a more sophisticated application.\"\n\"The path to application might be to merge this with multiple concepts in the field,\" added Cummer. \"Adding multiple sound sources and structures to create more complexity might be what nudges us over the edge in some applications.\"\n", "中文原文": "杜克大学的工程师设计了一种新的方法，利用声波以复杂的方式操纵悬浮在液体中的微小颗粒。这种技术被称为“阴影波导”，只使用两个声源就能在室内形成一个严格限制的、空间复杂的声场，而不需要任何内部结构。该技术为快速发展的声学镊子平台提供了一套新的功能，该平台在化学反应控制、微机器人、药物输送、细胞和组织工程等领域都有应用。这项研究发表在8月18日的《科学进展》杂志上。声波镊子是一种利用声波操纵悬浮在液体中的小颗粒的新兴技术。由于没有物理物体接触粒子，这项技术是温和的，没有生物相容性问题，也不需要标签，这使得它成为处理微妙生物分子的诱人选择。在生物医学领域，声波镊子可以捕捉、旋转和移动颗粒或有机体，用于检查、分类或其他应用。他们可以将某些试剂和化学物质分开，然后允许它们以精确的数量混合以控制反应。这项技术还提供了一种途径，在使用任何数量的技术将不同的材料固定在适当的地方创造新类型的材料之前，可以对不同的材料进行图案化。尽管这项技术潜力巨大，但它确实有其局限性。目前的大多数设备使用多个声源，放置在充满液体的腔室周围，形成一个棋盘状的区域，可以捕获和移动粒子彼此步调一致。这使得独立于彼此或通过复杂的模式来操纵粒子变得困难。后者可以通过在腔室中包括固体通道结构来实现，但这可能会损害微妙的颗粒，并限制样品通过系统的速度。为了克服这些限制，杜克大学威廉·杨格杰出工程学教授史蒂夫·卡默转向了受超材料启发的想法。超材料是由许多单独的工程特征组成的合成材料，这些特征共同产生自然界中没有的特性。“我们想把声波能量注入腔室，并使用腔室外面的一个结构来控制里面声波的形状，”Cummer说。“结果有点像声音的光纤，它塑造了声音的传播，并故意将其部分能量泄漏到腔室中--一种声音阴影--以虚拟通道控制内部的粒子。”在这篇新论文中，Cummer和在他实验室工作的博士后研究员Junfei Li与Duke大学William Bevan杰出工程学教授Tony Huang合作，展示了他们的影子波导方法的各种能力。每个阴影波导都是通过3D打印创建的，模具具有特定的功能，以控制腔内的粒子。一种称为聚二甲基硅氧烷(PDMS)的有机硅被倒入每个半管模具中，其特征是在成品中创建通道。PDMS具有与水非常相似的声学特性，这使得声波可以很容易地从阴影波导传播到腔室中。PDMS内充满空气的通道的模式决定了声波进入腔室的位置和方式，允许研究人员创建广泛的复杂声场来控制粒子。Cummer和Li使用这种设置来捕获和移动单个微粒沿着多个复杂的路径通过腔室。通过设置两个声源--一个在阴影波导的两端--研究人员表明，他们可以以精确控制的速度沿着缓慢弯曲的弧线泵送粒子。有了这个演示，研究人员现在正在寻找增加他们发明的复杂性，要么使波导动态可重构，要么将其与其他现有的声学镊子方法合并。李说：“声学设备很难实现可重构，但我们希望找到一种方法来实现这一目标，因为这将极大地提高这项技术的可用性。”“目前，我们正在寻找具体的挑战，我们可以调整这些阴影波导来解决，将其从概念验证演示转移到更复杂的应用。”“应用的途径可能是将这与该领域的多个概念合并，”Cummer补充道。“增加多个声源和结构来创造更多的复杂性可能是在某些应用中推动我们超越边缘的原因。”", "中文源标题": "‘阴影波导’投射复杂的声学图案来控制粒子", "英文整编": "Recently, Duke University researchers in the United States designed a \"shadow waveguide\" technology that uses sound waves to manipulate tiny particles in suspended liquid.

In the experiment, the researchers injected sound wave energy into the chamber, and used the outer structure of the chamber to control the internal sound wave shape. The results show that the optical fiber with sound wave shape is similar to sound, which can leak part of its energy into the chamber by shaping sound propagation, promote the formation of sound shadow, and control internal particles through virtual channel.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army)\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. — The U.S. Army opened the doors of a one-stop-shop for development and integration ofdirected energy capabilitiesat Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, last week as the Space and Missile Defense Symposium kicked off.\nThe Directed Energy Systems Integration Laboratory, or DESIL, will help speed up and streamline laser weapons research and development as the Army seeks to incorporate the technology into combat systems.\nSimulation, component and subsystem testing, and verification and validation of overall systems can all be done in one lab at one location, Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler, the Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command commander told Defense News in an interview at the SMD Symposium. The lab’s capabilities will help reduce technical and schedule risk for programs.\nAnd it’s not just a lab. Beyond two huge garage doors is a 400-meter outdoor range with an enormous mound of earth at one end which will serve as a test range. The large earth mound at the end of the range serves as a backstop to absorb the laser energy in testing.\nKarbler is a former commander of Army Test and Evaluation Command, so he said he sees the value that a lab like the DESIL will provide to shorten the process of evaluating, developing and testing of new capabilities before fielding.\n“I just go right out, I test it, and then I get to analyze the results right away and fix it right away versus going out to the range, maybe doing something, but then I have to bring it all back or ship all the [hardware] back. And then I own the range time,” Karbler said. “So it’s going to be a much tighter circle, tighter timeline, from concept, sub-component, component system testing, analysis, regression analysis to retesting if needed.”\nThe Army is outfitting itsStryker Combat Vehicle with a 50-kilowatt laserfor Short-Range Air Defense and it is scaling up laser capability to deliver a300-kilowatt laser on heavy truckas part of itsIndirect Fires Protection Capabilitythat will use a variety of effects to neutralize unmanned aircraft systems, cruise missiles and rockets, artillery and mortar threats.\nRELATED\nNorthrop bows out of competition to build laser weapon for Strykers\nA Northrop Grumman team competing to integrate a 50-kilowatt laser onto a Stryker combat vehicle ran into issues ahead of a combat shoot-off this summer, which resulted in an early exit from the program.\nByJenJudson\nThe service also recently announced it would work to put a20-kilowatt laser on a small Infantry Squad Vehicleto defeat small drone threats on the move.\nMuch of the industry helping the Army work on these efforts are based in the Huntsville area includingLeidos-owned Dyneticsand Lockheed Martin. The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office, which focuses on directed energy development, also is headquartered in town.\nThe new lab will be the place where all future laser weapon technology experiments can “become reality,” Nicole Olbricht, chief of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command’s Technical Center’s systems integration division, told Defense News on a tour of the new facility.\n“Huntsville is kind of the center for the Army right now for this,” Olbricht said. “So we’re essentially co-located with the customers, with the developers, the testers, with the integrators.”\nRedstone will be the home for project offices like the Directed Energy-Short Range Air Defense system (DE-SHORAD) and the IFPC program currently in development.\nThe laser analysis team will also be co-located with the lab. The Army had just begun to break ground on the facility that will be next door as Defense News toured the DESIL digs.\n“Prior to firing the laser downrange the laboratory engineers will be able to define the quality of the laser system beam,” Olbricht explained, by firing a laser into an instrumentation system, capturing data, and evaluating results. Then the laser can be fired downrange and the results can be compared, she added.\nThe laboratory will serve as a key location to conduct modeling and simulation to support how laser systems might perform in battlefield scenarios and against a variety of threats.\nThe U.S. Army's Directed Energy Systems Integration Laboratory (DESIL) houses a High Power Laser Beam Dump that can absorb extremely high amounts of energy for a long period of time. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army)\nSome of the capabilities that allow for indoor laser testing include the Robust Electric Laser Initiative that is capable of multi-kilowatt firing and helps prepare the lab to ensure laser instrumentation is ready.\nThe Army’s lab also houses a system called SMASH – or Small Measurement and Analysis System for High-energy laser systems. “SMASH measures the thermal properties and optics effects after the laser is fired for a short period of time,” Olbricht said. “From the results delivered from the shot profile, SMASH analysis can create a basis of beam quality.”\nAnother key piece of equipment in the lab is the High Power Laser Beam Dump, which absorbs “extremely high amounts of energy for a long period of time,” Olbricht said.\nThe system includes components capable of circulating 120 gallons of water per minute. The water is heated through the laser firing process and returns to a water tank through a closed-loop system that cools the water and purifies it through reverse osmosis. Impurities in the water can “lead to catastrophic events for the system during laser tests,” Olbricht explained.\nThe lab was constructed as a minor military construction project, costing less than $6 million to build, an Army spokesperson told Defense News.\nThe lab will be sustained “on a reimbursable basis in that the Directed Energy programs and related organizations pay a small reimbursable use fee to utilize the capabilities when required,” the spokesperson added.\n", "中文原文": "比延贾德森8月18日下午7:30美国陆军的新激光武器测试范围在阿拉巴马州红石兵工厂的定向能系统集成实验室之外。（美国陆军供图）阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔。-上周，随着太空和导弹防御研讨会的开始，美国陆军在阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔的红石兵工厂打开了定向能能力开发和集成的一站式商店的大门。定向能系统集成实验室(DESIL)将有助于加快和简化激光武器的研究和开发，因为陆军寻求将这项技术纳入战斗系统。陆军太空和导弹防御司令部司令丹·卡布勒中将在SMD研讨会上接受《国防新闻》采访时说，仿真、组件和子系统测试以及整个系统的验证和验证都可以在一个地方的一个实验室中完成。该实验室的能力将有助于降低项目的技术和时间表风险。而且这不仅仅是个实验室。在两扇巨大的车库门之外，是一个400米的室外靶场，一端是一个巨大的土堆，将作为测试靶场。靶场末端的大土丘作为一个后盾，在测试中吸收激光能量。Karbler是陆军测试和评估司令部的前指挥官，所以他说他看到了像DESIL这样的实验室将提供的价值，以缩短部署前评估、开发和测试新能力的过程。“我只是马上出去，测试它，然后我马上分析结果，马上修复它，而不是去靶场，也许做些什么，但然后我必须把它全部带回来，或者把所有的（硬件）运回来。然后我拥有射程时间，“卡布勒说。“因此，从概念、子组件、组件系统测试、分析、回归分析到需要的重新测试，这将是一个更紧的循环，更紧的时间表。”陆军正在为其Stryker战车配备50千瓦激光近程防空，并正在扩大激光能力，在重型卡车上发射300千瓦激光，这是其直接火力保护能力的一部分，将使用各种效果来抵消无人驾驶飞机系统、巡航导弹和火箭、火炮和迫击炮威胁。相关的诺斯罗普退出为史崔克制造激光武器的竞争诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的一个团队正在竞争将50千瓦的激光器集成到史崔克战斗车辆上，在今年夏天的战斗射击前遇到了问题，导致该项目提前退出。比延贾德森该部门最近还宣布，将努力在一辆小型步兵队车辆上安装一台20千瓦的激光器，以击败移动中的小型无人机威胁。帮助军队进行这些努力的大部分行业都位于亨茨维尔地区，包括莱多斯拥有的动力公司和洛克希德·马丁公司。陆军的快速能力和关键技术办公室，专注于定向能开发，总部也设在镇上。陆军太空和导弹防御司令部技术中心系统集成司司长尼科尔·奥尔布里希特（Nicole Olbricht）在参观新设施时告诉《国防新闻》(Defense News)，新实验室将是所有未来激光武器技术实验“成为现实”的地方。奥尔布里希特说：“亨茨维尔现在是军队的中心。”“因此，我们基本上与客户、开发人员、测试人员和集成商处于同一位置。”红石将是项目办公室的所在地，如定向能-短程防空系统（DE-SHORAD）和目前正在开发的IFPC计划。激光分析小组也将与实验室合署办公。军队刚刚开始在隔壁的设施上破土动工，国防新闻正在德西尔挖掘区巡回演出。“在向下发射激光之前，实验室工程师将能够定义激光系统光束的质量，”奥尔布里希特解释说，通过向仪器系统发射激光，捕获数据，并评估结果。然后激光可以向下发射，结果可以比较，她补充说。该实验室将作为进行建模和仿真的关键场所，以支持激光系统在战场场景和应对各种威胁时的性能。美国陆军的定向能系统集成实验室(DESIL)拥有一个高功率激光束转储器，可以在很长一段时间内吸收极高的能量。（美国陆军供图）允许室内激光测试的一些能力包括强健的电激光倡议，它能够发射多千瓦，并帮助准备实验室，以确保激光仪器准备就绪。陆军的实验室还拥有一个名为SMASH或小型高能激光测量和分析系统的系统。“SMASH测量激光在短时间内发射后的热特性和光学效应", "中文源标题": "美国陆军为激光武器挖掘新沙箱", "英文整编": "The U.S. Army recently opened the Directional Energy System Integration Laboratory (DESIL) for the development and integration of directional energy capabilities at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, to accelerate the integration of laser weapon technology into combat systems.

Unlike DARPA’s typical four-year programs, AIEs are designed to be fast-tracked (~18 months in duration) research efforts that help determine the feasibility of an AI concept. The goal of the ASKE project was to develop AI technologies capable of automating some of the manual processes of scientific knowledge discovery, curation, and application. It identified how and where AI could accelerate the process of scientific modeling, and ultimately improve researchers’ ability to conduct rigorous and timely experimentation and validation.\nScientific models – or conceptual representations of complex systems – are used by myriad communities to understand and explain the world around us. Computationally creating these models is a largely manual, cumbersome task that requires scouring mountains of research for relevant content, and then executing multi-step processes to build, validate, and test the resulting model. The challenges to model creation are compounded by the many opportunities to lose information at each step of the process, or for other errors to occur. ASKE’s goal was to address these challenges by developing approaches to locating new data and scientific resources, comb them for useful information, compare those findings with existing research, and then integrate the relevant data into machine-curated expert models and execute them in robust ways. The project’s research efforts were split across two technical areas. One focused on machine-assisted curation, where researchers explored ways to use AI to extract useful information from research and build it into new models. The second area focused on machine-assisted inference, where AI uses those newly developed models to help researchers understand the modeled system, answer complex questions, or make predictions.\nLeveraging streamlined contracting procedures and funding mechanisms, DARPA was able to get researchers on board within three months of the initial opportunity announcement. Things kicked-off quickly, and the ASKE teams began developing a number of novel approaches. Researchers from academic institutions and commercial companies devised ways to automate the extraction of knowledge and information from existing models (including across diverse data types such as written text, equations, and software code), and created technologies to query and link information across literature. They created ways to universally represent and explain different modeling frameworks, while also developing tools that allow computational models to be automatically maintained and/or updated as new discoveries and information becomes available. “The ASKE AIE demonstrated a 50x speedup, extending an existing epidemiology model with additional dimensions and states when compared to state-of-the-art manual processes,” said Joshua Elliott, the DARPA program manager that led ASKE. “Using the same tools, it also showed that a new computational model in a different domain could be created 8x faster with ASKE than with current procedures.”\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, researchers had an opportunity to test their developments and demonstrate their effectiveness. Scientists, researchers, and medical experts the world over generated hundreds of models to help understand and predict various aspects of the virus’ spread and impact, creating a proliferation of scientific knowledge that was difficult to compare, verify, and validate. Much of the knowledge was locked in code, especially legacy code, which makes it harder to understand the parameter choices and assumptions made in the model. As new information and insights became available, an already challenging situation was exacerbated by the difficulties of extracting and representing these new findings, and modeling their effect on the evolving COVID-19 knowledgebase. Authorities rely on expert generated insights to create public policy interventions, making the quality and verification of these models exceedingly important.\nASKE researchers sought to enable better model understanding, inter-comparison, and contextualization by applying their tools to assess, compare, refine, and validate models extracted from code and documentation. The developed tools were used to rapidly auto-extract multi-modal information from publications and assimilate mechanistic fragments to knowledge graphs and executable models to inform the community’s understanding of the virus and possible treatments.\nWorking in partnership with the scientific community and government agencies, the ASKE tools proved effective across multiple domains. As one example, researchers from Galois worked with government officials and applied their ASKE component to contextualize and adapt national epidemiology models and data to local conditions. Their efforts enabled local planners to evaluate which models provided the best estimation of the impact of the pandemic on vital hospital resources, such as ICU beds and ventilators, using local demographic, geographic, and social behavioral data. In another effort, researchers from Harvard Medical School partnered with the scientific community to use ASKE tools to produce candidate drug lists and gene targets for wet lab experiments. The work resulted in positive early results for Vitamin-D and MDL-28170. Other experiments with these tools are currently in progress.\nThe success of ASKE has led to the creation of a larger DARPA program called the Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Modeling (ASKEM) program. ASKEM aims to create a knowledge-modeling-simulation ecosystem, empowered with the AI approaches and tools needed for the agile creation, sustainment, and enhancement of the complex models and simulators necessary to support expert knowledge- and data-informed decision making in diverse missions and scientific domains. The goal is to enable experts to maintain, reuse, and adapt large collections of heterogeneous data, knowledge, and models – with traceability across knowledge sources, model assumptions, and model fitness.\nThe ASKEM-developed tools will be demonstrated in several scientific domains, building on ASKE’s work with viral epidemics such as COVID-19, as well as the physics and impacts of space weather.\n“With ASKEM, we hope to enable expert modeling to adapt at the pace of the modern world, allowing decision-makers to get in front of disasters, global changes, and our adversaries in order to avoid damages and improve the timeliness and effectiveness of our responses,” said Elliott. “ASKE produced novel proofs of concept that enable users to extract models from legacy code, and to more efficiently update, enhance, and validate models. ASKEM will expand on this foundation to produce modeling tools that apply to multiple scientific domains and produce a complete, sustainable infrastructure.\" Interested proposers can learn more about the ASKEM program during a Proposers Day that DARPA will host on December 8, 2021, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) via Zoom. Advance registration is required to attend. More information is available on sam.gov.\nASKE demonstrated the potential for DARPA’s AI Exploration program and its nimble approach to exploring new AI concepts. This fast-tracked AI research effort helped jump-start a long-term program that requires additional resources and expertise – but could conceivably generate significant benefits to both defense and commercial domains. Conversely, AIEs also allow DARPA to understand where additional advancement might be needed in other fields or areas before committing to a larger undertaking.\nAIE is a key component of a broader agency-wide investment strategy in AI called the AI Next Campaign.

These micromechanical resonators play an essential role in cellphone communication. Buffeted by the cacophony of radio frequencies in the airwaves, these resonators select just the right frequencies for transmitting and receiving signals between mobile devices. \nWith the growing importance of these resonators, scientists need a reliable and efficient way to make sure the devices are working properly. That's best accomplished by carefully studying the acoustic waves that the resonators generate.\nNow, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and their colleagues have developed an instrument to image these acoustic waves over a wide range of frequencies and produce \"movies\" of them with unprecedented detail.\nThe researchers measured acoustic vibrations as rapid as 12 gigahertz (GHz, or billions of cycles per second) and may be able to extend those measurements to 25 GHz, providing the necessary frequency coverage for 5G communications as well as for potentially powerful future applications in quantum information.\nThe challenge of measuring these acoustic vibrations is likely to increase as 5G networks dominate wireless communications, generating even tinier acoustic waves.\nThe new NIST instrument captures these waves in action by relying on a device known as an optical interferometer. The illumination source for this interferometer, ordinarily a steady beam of laser light, is in this case a laser that pulses 50 million times a second, which is significantly slower than the vibrations being measured.\nThe laser interferometer compares two pulses of laser light that travel along different paths. One pulse travels through a microscope that focuses the laser light on a vibrating micromechanical resonator and is then reflected back. The other pulse acts as a reference, traveling along a path that is continually adjusted so that its length is within a micrometer (one millionth of a meter) of the distance traveled by the first pulse.\nWhen the two pulses meet, the light waves from each pulse overlap, creating an interference pattern—a set of dark and light fringes where the waves cancel or reinforce one another. As subsequent laser pulses enter the interferometer, the interference pattern changes as the microresonator vibrates up and down. From the changing pattern of the fringes, researchers can measure the height (amplitude) and phase of the vibrations at the location of the laser spot on the micromechanical resonator.\nNIST researcher Jason Gorman and his colleagues deliberately chose a reference laser that pulses between 20 and 250 times more slowly than the frequency at which the micromechanical resonator vibrates. That strategy enabled the laser pulses illuminating the resonator to, in effect, slow down the acoustic vibrations, similar to the way that a strobe light appears to slow down dancers in a nightclub.\nThe slowdown, which converts acoustic vibrations that oscillate at GHz frequencies to megahertz (MHz, millions of cycles per second), is important because the light detectors used by the NIST team operate much more precisely, with less noise, at these lower frequencies.\n\"Moving to lower frequencies removes interference from communication signals typically found at microwave frequencies and allows us to use photodetectors with lower electrical noise,\" said Gorman.\nEach pulse lasts only 120 femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second), providing highly precise moment-to-moment information on the vibrations. The laser scans across the micromechanical resonator so that the amplitude and phase of the vibrations can be sampled across the entire surface of the vibrating device, producing high-resolution images over a wide range of microwave frequencies.\nBy combining these measurements, averaged over many samples, the researchers can create three-dimensional movies of a microresonator's vibrational modes. Two types of microresonators were used in the study; one had dimensions of 12 micrometers (millionths of a meter) by 65 micrometers; the other measured 75 micrometers on a side—about the width of a human hair.\nNot only can the images and movies reveal whether a micromechanical resonator is operating as expected, they can also indicate problem areas, such as places where acoustic energy is leaking out of the resonator. The leaks make resonators less efficient and lead to loss of information in quantum acoustic systems. By pinpointing problematic areas, the technique gives scientists the information they need to improve resonator design.\nIn the Feb. 4, 2022, edition of Nature Communications, the researchers reported that they could image acoustic vibrations that have an amplitude (height) as small as 55 femtometers (quadrillionths of a meter), about one-five-hundredth the diameter of a hydrogen atom.\nOver the past decade, physicists have suggested that micromechanical resonators in this frequency range may also serve to store fragile quantum information and to transfer the data from one part of a quantum computer to another.\nEstablishing an imaging system that can routinely measure micromechanical resonators for these applications will require further research. But the current study is already a milestone in assessing the ability of micromechanical resonators to accurately perform at the high frequencies that will be required for effective communication and for quantum computing in the near future, Gorman said.\n", "中文原文": "每一部手机里都有一颗微小的机械心脏，每秒跳动数十亿次。这些微机械谐振器在手机通信中起着至关重要的作用。受到电波中不和谐的无线电频率的冲击，这些谐振器选择合适的频率在移动设备之间发射和接收信号。随着这些谐振器的重要性越来越大，科学家们需要一种可靠有效的方法来确保设备正常工作。这最好通过仔细研究共振器产生的声波来实现。现在，美国国家标准与技术研究所(NIST)的研究人员及其同事开发了一种仪器，可以在广泛的频率范围内对这些声波进行成像，并以前所未有的细节制作它们的“电影”。研究人员测量了速度高达12千兆赫(GHz，或每秒数十亿周期）的声学振动，并可能将这些测量扩展到25千兆赫，为5G通信以及未来潜在的强大量子信息应用提供必要的频率覆盖。随着5G网络主导无线通信，产生更微小的声波，测量这些声波振动的挑战可能会增加。新的NIST仪器依靠一种被称为光学干涉仪的设备捕捉这些波。这种干涉仪的照明光源通常是一束稳定的激光束，在这种情况下是一种每秒脉冲5000万次的激光，这比正在测量的振动要慢得多。激光干涉仪比较沿着不同路径传播的两个激光脉冲。一个脉冲通过显微镜，将激光聚焦在振动的微机械谐振器上，然后反射回来。另一个脉冲作为基准，沿着一条不断调整的路径行进，使其长度在第一个脉冲行进距离的微米（百万分之一米）内。当两个脉冲相遇时，来自每个脉冲的光波重叠，形成干涉图案--一组暗光条纹，在这里波相互抵消或加强。随着随后的激光脉冲进入干涉仪，干涉图样随着微谐振器上下振动而变化。研究人员可以根据微机械谐振腔上激光光斑位置处条纹的变化模式来测量振动的高度（振幅）和相位。NIST研究员杰森·戈尔曼和他的同事们故意选择了一种比微机械谐振器振动频率慢20到250倍的参考激光器。这种策略使激光脉冲照亮谐振器，实际上减缓了声学振动，就像频闪灯在夜总会减缓舞者的速度一样。这种减速将以GHz频率振荡的声学振动转换为兆赫(MHz，每秒数百万个周期），这很重要，因为NIST团队使用的光探测器在这些较低的频率下工作得更精确，噪音更小。戈尔曼说：“移动到更低的频率可以消除通常在微波频率下发现的通信信号的干扰，并允许我们使用具有更低电噪声的光电探测器。”每个脉冲仅持续120飞秒（千分之四秒），提供了高度精确的振动时刻信息。激光扫描微机械谐振器，使振动的振幅和相位可以在振动装置的整个表面上取样，在很宽的微波频率范围内产生高分辨率的图像。通过将这些测量值结合起来，在许多样本上平均，研究人员可以创建微谐振器振动模式的三维电影。研究中使用了两种类型的微谐振器；一个尺寸为12微米（百万分之一米）乘65微米；另一个侧面测量了75微米--大约是人类头发的宽度。图像和电影不仅可以揭示微机械谐振器是否按预期运行，还可以指示问题区域，如声能从谐振器泄漏的地方。这种泄漏使谐振腔效率降低，并导致量子声学系统中的信息丢失。通过精确定位有问题的区域，这项技术为科学家提供了改进谐振器设计所需的信息。在2022年2月4日的《自然通讯》杂志上，研究人员报告说，他们可以成像振幅（高度）小至55飞米（一米的千分之四）的声波振动，大约是氢原子直径的五百分之一。在过去的十年里，物理学家们提出在这个频率上的微机械谐振器", "中文源标题": "5G频闪灯：NIST成像系统聚焦每一部手机核心的微小机械心脏", "英文整编": "Recently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a new instrument, which can image the sound waves emitted by micromachined resonators in a wide frequency range and generate high-precision images.

During the experiment, the researchers specially selected a reference laser, which made its pulse 20 ~ 250 times slower than the vibration frequency of MEMS resonator. Researchers say that when sound waves move to lower frequencies, communication signal interference usually found at microwave frequencies can be eliminated, and photodetectors with lower electrical noise can be used. The detector uses laser to scan the whole MEMS resonator, so as to sample the vibration amplitude and phase on the whole surface of the vibration equipment, thus generating high-resolution images in a wide range of microwave frequencies. In addition, the imaged image and video can not only reveal whether the micromachined resonator is operating as expected, but also indicate the problem area, such as the place where acoustic energy leaks from the resonator.

The innovation could improve the performance of these devices while lowering their environmental impact.\n\"Biosensors are common in wearable electronics, but today they are powered by batteries,\" says Ning Yan, a professor in the department of chemical engineering and applied chemistry in the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, and a co-author of the study.\n\"This makes them bulky, inconvenient and costly. Sensors without batteries could be thinner, smaller and cheaper. You would never again have to worry about forgetting to charge the battery. You could just stick it on your skin, and it would be powered by your natural movements,\" she added.\nThe principle behind the innovation is the trioboelectric effect, a form of static electricity. Because some materials attract electrons more than others, repeatedly bringing two different materials in contact and then separating them can cause an electrical charge to build up between them.\nResearchers from around the world are experimenting with devices known as triboelectric nanogenerators, which make use of this effect to generate small amounts of electricity.\nMost current designs incorporate synthetic materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), also known under the brand name Teflon. However, this material persists for long periods of time in the environment and concerns have been raised about its potential health effects.\nYan and her team wanted to see if it was possible to create a natural, biodegradable substitute.\n\"There has been some experimentation with using natural materials such as cellulose in these types of triboelectric generators,\" says Yan. \"But most teams have used cellulose only in the layer that loses electrons, which we call the tribopositive layer. We wanted to develop a natural substitute for the other side, the tribonegative layer.\"\nThe new material is made of nanofibrils, tiny strands of plant material hundreds of thousands of times thinner than a human hair.

They incorporated the material into a prototype triboelectric nanogenerator.\n\"Our key challenges were finding a highly efficient way to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and then storing enough of that energy to power the system,\" says Ban, who completed his doctorate at U of T. \"It was rewarding to achieve that while also limiting the environmental footprint of the multi-function system.\"\nThis device was able to generate 160 percent more voltage and 140 percent more current when compared with a similar device that used PTFE as the tribonegative layer.\nSimply by tapping the device on an acrylic plate during testing, the prototype was able to generate enough power to send out a radio-frequency ping every three minutes that was picked up by a nearby smartphone.\nIn theory, such a device could be inserted into the sole of a shoe, with the user generating electricity while walking or running.

Using new materials, researchers have realized the function of obtaining electric energy from daily sports such as walking. The new material is made of nanofibers. Researchers added natural polymer lignin to this new material. In many pulp and paper products, lignin is an impurity to be removed, but researchers found that retaining about 30% lignin in nanofibers can improve their performance as friction negative materials. By integrating this material into the triboelectric nano-generator, it is found that compared with similar equipment using PTFE as the negative friction layer, this equipment can generate 160% more voltage and 140% more current, and this device can be inserted into the sole, so that users can generate electricity when walking or running.

Photo Credit: Boom Supersonic\nBoom Supersonic (Denver, Colo., U.S.) revealed at Farnborough the latest design iteration of the company’s Overture aircraft. Carrying 65-80 passengers at twice the speed of today’s airliners and running on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Overture will fly Mach 1.7 over water with a range of 4,250 nautical miles. Features of the modified design include four engines to reduce noise and operating costs, a fuselage that is larger in diameter at the front than the back to increase efficiency, gull wings to improve handling and carbon fiber construction to reduce weight and meet design contour requirements.\nAdditionally, Boom Supersonic announced that it will begin outfitting a new 70,000-square-foot hardware ground test facility in Centennial, Colo., to house its first full-scale Overture testing model and flight deck simulators. Earlier this year, Boom announced its selection of the Piedmont Triad area in North Carolina, U.S., for its first Overture Superfactory and remains on track to begin production in 2024. Finally, Boom reported a new partnering agreement with Northrop Grumman to develop special-mission variants of Overture.\nHydrogen-electric propulsion program milestones\nGKN Aerospace (Bristol, U.K.) reported at Farnborough that its H2GEAR hydrogen-electric propulsion program has passed a major milestone by completing its first round of system-level trade studies. The studies focused on propulsion system architecture and subsystem technology selection for hypothetical 19, 48 and 96 PAX (passenger) concept aircraft. Work to date shows that GKN Aerospace’s developments in the fuel cell system integration, combined with hyperconducting power network and motor drive systems, will enable hydrogen electric propulsion to be scaled up more quickly than originally thought.\nThe hyperconducting systems proposed by GKN Aerospace use the onboard liquid hydrogen as a heat sink, cooling the electrical conductors to temperatures less than -200°C to dramatically reduce their electrical resistivity. This facilitates electrical power distribution at low voltage, lower-mass conducting cables and electric motors that are set to achieve over 99% efficiency. Unlike superconducting systems, which exhibit zero electrical resistance, a hyperconducting system would use more conventional conductor materials and is deliverable sooner, offering a greater overall impact on global emissions in the foreseeable future.\nIntegrated ground-based demonstration of the H2GEAR technologies is scheduled for 2025; entry-into-service of the first hyperconducting hydrogen-powered aircraft could be as early as 2035.\nWing of Tomorrow prototype assembly completed\nAirbus (Tolouse, France) announced at the 2022 Farnborough International Airshow that its transnational R&T program, Wing of Tomorrow (WOT), has successfully delivered a first full-size wing demonstrator that will help mature next-generation wing technologies. The completion of the first of three fully composite wing demonstrators marks the integration of more than 100 component and manufacturing technologies that include an all-new industrial assembly system, and which have helped validate key automation targets. The wing includes many applications of innovative composites M&P, including thermoplastic ribs, an OOA VBO rear spar, infused skins, newly designed leading edge spars and more. The new build philosophy on WOT also eradicates in-tank working and enables manual and automated assembly to be smoothly integrated into an optimized industrial system.\nFull announcement can be found here.\nRead: Materials & Processes: Tooling for composites\nMiddle-mile cargo delivery drones\nDronamics (Sofia, Bulgaria), a middle-mile cargo drone developer and operator, and Quickstep Holdings Ltd. (New South Wales, Australia), a Tier One manufacturer and the largest independent aerospace composites business in Australia, are working together to accelerate the production of the European company’s Black Swan cargo drones. With the first units landing in 2023, Dronamics and Quickstep’s long-term plan targets the ramp-up of production of hundreds of Black Swan cargo drones annually in the next four years.\nRead the full announcement here.\neVTOL cabin concept unveiled\nPhoto Credit: Supernal, Hyundai Motor Group\nSupernal (Washington, D.C., U.S.) revealed its initial electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle cabin concept at Farnborough International Airshow, providing the first look at how Hyundai Motor Group (Seoul, South Korea) is integrating automotive capabilities to develop the advanced air mobility (AAM) market.\nSupernal’s five-seat cabin concept design embodies biomimicry — a butterfly in this case — and the company’s pillars of safety, human-centered design and environmental responsibility. With sustainability as a priority, the cabin concept incorporates materials such as advanced recyclable carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP), durable plant-based leather, recycled plastic fabric and responsibly sourced woods. Supernal hopes to certify its eVTOL vehicle for commercial use in the U.S. starting in 2028, with the E.U. and U.K. following soon after. Read the full announcement here.\nU.K. lays out plans for next-generation combat aircraft\nThe U.K. Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace MP, has confirmed plans for Britain to lead the development of a new flying combat air demonstrator — to fly within the next five years — which will play a critical role in the delivery of the region’s Future Combat Air System, Tempest.\nLaunched in 2018, the flagship project is part of a suite of novel technologies being developed by Team Tempest, involving a number of suppliers — led by BAE Systems (Farnborough) — and the Ministry of Defence. These concepts are designed to demonstrate and test the next generation combat air skills, tools, processes and techniques needed to ensure Tempest enters service in 2035. The project, for example, is developing composite materials and additive manufacturing (AM) to produce lightweight, power-dense configurations capable of operating at higher temperatures.\n", "中文原文": "像往常一样，范堡罗为GKN航空航天、乔比、空客、劳斯莱斯、博姆超音速和其他公司在航空航天、国防和高级空中机动空间的各种公告提供了一个平台。两年一度的范堡罗国际航展(FIA)是航空航天和国防工业的贸易展览会，于本周，2022年7月18日至22日在英国范堡罗举行。这是自2018年以来的第一次范堡罗展，是对后COVID世界在商业航空航天、太空、国防、可持续性、创新、未来飞行和劳动力发展方面如何发展的试金石。以下是整个展会上宣布的与复合材料行业相关的一些消息的汇总。给AAM带来电力推进和氢气劳斯莱斯（英国伦敦）和现代汽车集团（韩国首尔）在2022年范堡罗国际航展上宣布了合作计划，将全电力推进和氢燃料电池技术引入先进空中机动(AAM)市场。合作伙伴关系将利用劳斯莱斯的航空和认证能力，以及现代汽车集团的氢燃料电池技术和产业化能力。这些公司表示，在全电动飞机推进系统中使用氢燃料电池系统的好处是，它是一种零排放、静音和可靠的机载电源，能够实现电力供应的可扩展性和远距离飞行范围。现代将与劳斯莱斯合作，将氢燃料电池、存储系统和基础设施引入航空航天市场，并将这项技术推广到现代的RAM车辆和劳斯莱斯的全电动和混合动力推进系统产品中。英国城市航空机动性认证Joby Aviation（美国加利福尼亚州圣克鲁斯）宣布，它已经正式申请其电动垂直起降（eVTOL）飞机设计获得在英国使用的认证。虽然Joby目前正在向美国联邦航空管理局(FAA)寻求其飞机的类型认证(TC)，并预计美国将成为其第一个运营市场，但这一申请将使Joby在美国的认证同时得到英国民航局(CAA)的验证，Joby被认为是第一家申请FAA TC国外验证的eVTOL公司。英国先进移动生态系统联盟总部位于英国的垂直航空航天公司（布里斯托尔）、维珍大西洋公司（克劳利）、阿特金斯公司（爱普生）、天空港口公司（伦敦）和空中交通管制服务提供商NATS，以及连接地方弹射器公司和领先的学术机构、克兰菲尔德大学和沃里克大学WMG宣布成立高级移动生态系统联盟。在两年的时间里，这些组织将共同开发一个项目中的关键技术和基础设施，该项目将大大加快在英国引入AAM。这将包括创建和测试飞机电气化、空域管理、地面基础设施、操作程序以及在该地区实施新的空中客运模式所需的系统和支持商业案例方面的技术发展。“该项目将展示英国AAM生态系统的可行性，该生态系统使用由维珍大西洋航空公司运营的垂直航空公司的无排放VX4 eVTOL飞机。布里斯托尔机场到英格兰西南部的一个机场之间以及伦敦希思罗机场和生活实验室vertiport之间将进行两次物理飞行。根据最初的新闻稿，第三次模拟飞行将展示伦敦市和布里斯托尔机场之间的城市连通性。在这里阅读完整的报告。VX4飞机的新变型垂直航空航天公司（英国布里斯托尔）正与航空航天、国防和安全公司巴布科克国际公司（英国伦敦）合作，探索其VX4 eVTOL飞机的新应用。据报道，这款飞机能够行驶100多英里的距离，在低噪音的情况下实现每小时200多英里的最高速度，已经证明了在客运市场上的需求，这些客户包括维珍大西洋航空公司、飞机出租商如Avolon（爱尔兰都柏林）以及直升机和旅游运营商如Bristow（英国戴斯）和Iberojet（西班牙帕尔马）。垂直航空航天公司和巴布科克国际公司将探索的其他应用包括航空EMS和货物运输。两家公司还将致力于开发模块化维护、维修和大修(MRO)能力，以实现在偏远和具有挑战性的环境中对飞机进行成本有效的维护，并最大限度地提高可用性。百合与布里斯托的战略合作伙伴关系Bristow Group Inc.（英国德克萨斯州休斯顿），一家可持续垂直飞行解决方案提供商；Lilium N.V.（德国慕尼黑），一家eVTOL飞机开发商", "中文源标题": "2022年范堡罗国际航展集锦", "英文整编": "Farnborough International Air Show (FIA) was held in Britain from July 18 to 22, 2022.

The Pentagon is working with industry to explore the possibility that bomb, missile or laser-armedF-35scould destroy an attacking nuclear-armed Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) targeting the US, potentially bringing a new dimension to existing defenses.\nF-35s & ICBMs\nThe concept, according to industry and Pentagon developers, would be to useF-35weapons and sensors to detect or destroy an ICBM launch during its initial “boost” phase of upward flight toward the boundary of the earth’s atmosphere. TheF-35could use a “kinetic” solution wherein it fires upon and destroys a launchingICBM-- or a “sensor” solution where it “cues missile defense systems.”\nWhile PentagonF-35officials emphasize the F-35 program is currently focused on nearer-term efforts such as delivering software upgrades to the airplane, there is growing consensus that exploringF-35nuclear missile defense is something of great potential benefit. Early conversations and conceptual work are already underway.\nThe prospect of using anF-35for this purpose introduces a range of defensive possibilities not yet part of the Pentagon’s missile defense arsenal. For instance, an F-35 could fire air-to-ground bombs or missiles to expode an ICBM or even use lasers and electronic warfare to incinerate, jam or disable the flight trajectory of an attackingICBM. If an ICBM guidance system, or propulsion mechanisms were interfered with, an ICBM might be thrown off, heading into the ocean or an uninhabited area less likely to cause damage.\nAlso, a group of F-35s could potentially form some kind of networked “relay system” using the Multi-function Advanced Data Link (MADL) to deliver threat information across a fleet of aircraft in position to warn US missile defense systems. This MADL data link, which enables a group ofF-35sto all see the same thing in real-time while conducting a mission, could potentially extend the range of systems able to find or detect an enemyICBM. It goes without saying that the earlier Combatant Commanders and decision-makers learn of an attacking ICBM, the more time they have to consider and implement countermeasures or launch a counterattack.\nMany ICBM launch points developed by potential adversaries are lodged deep inland and heavily defended by air-defenses, making them harder for certain weapons and attack assets to reach.\nAlso, a 2014 Congressional Report, the US-China Economic and Security Review, contained a 70-page chapter on Chinese military modernization. Among its many findings, the report specifically cited Chinese “mobile”ICBMlaunchers with as many as 10 “reentry vehicles” in some cases. These weapons, of course, present significant new threats; the more reentry vehicles approaching a target, the more difficult the defense. With this in mind, an F-35 might bring an ability to use stealth, speed and maneuverability to operate above heavily defended inland areas to find, chase and destroy mobile launchers,\nThe initial launch or “boost” phase of an ICBM, it appears, would present the best opportunity for anF-35to have the intended missile-defense impact. Hitting an ICBM attack during the final, or “terminal” phase would present challenges due to the number of reentry vehicles. All of this raises the question as to whether anF-35could be part of an integrated system able to detect and knock out enemy ICBMswhile they are traveling in space. While difficult, it might someday be possible for an F-35 to use GPS or other air-mounted sensors to interact with satellites - which themselves could fire lasers or some kind of interceptor to hit an ICBM during space flight. In this scenario, an F-35 would function as a sensor or networked “node” and not an actual attacker, per se.\nAnF-35would bring something new to missile defense by potentially filing a needed niche or, at very least, greatly supplementing existing land-based systems. Unlike offensive nuclear deterrents such as air, sea and land weapons, US ICBM missile defense weapons are primarily land-based. A Ground Based Interceptor (GBI), for instance, stationed in Ft. Greely, Alaska or Vandenberg AFB, Calf., would fire up into space during an ICBMs mid-course phase of flight to intercept the attacking missile.\nThis presents a number of challenges, as GBIs need sensors or embedded technology enabling them to distinguish decoys from actual ICBMs. This is the reason for the Pentagon’s emerging Next Generation Interceptor, a technology designed to both detect and destroy multiple incoming missiles or decoys traveling through space. Multiple Kill Vehicle, as it sounds, integrates a number of interceptors onto one missile; numerous decoys flying alongside an ICBM can increase the chances that an actual nuclear weapon will continue on to its target. For this reason, sensors are being developed and designed to discriminate, or distinguish decoys from missiles.\nRegardless, identifying and knocking out large numbers of ICBMs is, by any estimation, a challenge. A single launch, from a rogue state such as North Korea only able to launch one or two ICBMs at most, presents a much more manageable threat for ground-based interceptors. An incoming salvo of ICBMs, by contrast, is a different equation. This leads to two strategies; the first would be an offensive deterrent using the US nuclear triad to stop a first strike from ever happening by ensuring a catastrophic retaliation -- and the second would encompass a range of ongoing technologically advanced defensive measures including things like satellites, lasers, Multiple Kill-Vehicles orF-35s.\nDestroying ICBMs is something quite different than tracking or intercepting a short or medium range ballistic missile. The F-35 is already developed in this capacity; the F-35 has been tested as an aerial node for the Navy’s Naval Integrated Fire Control - Counter Air system. This technology, now deployed, uses ship-based Aegis radar, an aerial sensor node and a guided SM-6 missile to knock out attacking missiles from ranges beyond-the-horizon. Since its inception, NIFC-CA used an E-2 Hawkeye surveillance plane as the aerial node. Now, the system can use a far more capable F-35 as the aerial sensor.\n", "中文原文": "F-35武器和传感器将在最初的“助推”阶段探测或摧毁洲际弹道导弹发射克里斯·奥斯本，战士MAVEN-军事现代化中心·2022年10月9日克里斯奥斯本，总统，军事现代化中心（华盛顿特区）五角大楼正与工业界合作，探索炸弹、导弹或激光装备F-35摧毁攻击美国的核武器洲际弹道导弹(ICBM)的可能性，这可能会给现有防御带来新的层面。F-35和洲际弹道导弹根据工业界和五角大楼开发人员的说法，这一概念将是在洲际弹道导弹发射向地球大气层边界向上飞行的最初“助推”阶段使用-35武器和传感器来探测或摧毁它。F-35可以使用一种“动能”解决方案，即它向发射的洲际弹道导弹开火并摧毁它--或者一种“传感器”解决方案，即它“提示导弹防御系统”。虽然五角大楼F-35官员强调，F-35计划目前侧重于近期努力，如为飞机提供软件升级，但越来越多的共识是，探索F-35核导弹防御系统具有巨大的潜在好处。早期的对话和概念工作已经在进行中。将ANF-35用于这一目的的前景引入了一系列防御可能性，但这还不是五角大楼导弹防御武库的一部分。例如，F-35可以发射空对地炸弹或导弹来暴露洲际弹道导弹，甚至使用激光和电子战来焚烧、堵塞或禁用攻击洲际弹道导弹的飞行轨迹。如果洲际弹道导弹制导系统或推进机构受到干扰，洲际弹道导弹可能会被抛出，进入海洋或无人居住的地区，不太可能造成损害。此外，一组F-35可能会使用多功能高级数据链(MADL)形成某种网络化的“中继系统”，在就位的飞机群中传递威胁信息，以警告美国导弹防御系统。这种MADL数据链能使一组35人以上的人在执行任务时实时看到相同的东西，这可能会扩大能够发现或检测灌肠弹道导弹的系统范围。不言而喻，战斗指挥官和决策者越早了解到洲际弹道导弹的攻击，他们就有越多的时间考虑和实施对策或发动反击。潜在对手开发的许多洲际弹道导弹发射点位于内陆深处，由防空系统严密防御，使某些武器和攻击资产更难到达。此外，2014年的一份国会报告《美中经济与安全评估》包含了一个关于中国军事现代化的70页章节。在它的许多发现中，该报告特别提到了中国的“移动”洲际弹道导弹发射器，在某些情况下有多达10个“再入飞行器”。当然，这些武器构成了重大的新威胁；接近目标的再入飞行器越多，防御难度就越大。考虑到这一点，F-35可能会带来利用隐身、速度和机动性在戒备森严的内陆地区上空行动的能力，以发现、追逐和摧毁移动发射器，洲际弹道导弹的初始发射或“助推”阶段，似乎是ANF-35达到预期导弹防御效果的最佳机会。由于再入飞行器的数量，在最后或“终端”阶段打击洲际弹道导弹将面临挑战。所有这些都提出了一个问题，即ANF-35是否可以成为一个综合系统的一部分，能够在敌方洲际弹道导弹在太空旅行时探测并击倒它们。虽然很难，但有一天F-35可能会使用全球定位系统或其他空中安装的传感器与卫星互动--卫星本身可以发射激光或某种拦截器，在太空飞行中击中洲际弹道导弹。在这种情况下，F-35将充当传感器或网络“节点”，而不是真正的攻击者。ANF-35将为导弹防御系统带来新的东西，因为它可能会成为一个必要的利基系统，或者至少是对现有的陆基系统的极大补充。与进攻性核威慑武器如海、空、陆武器不同，美国洲际弹道导弹导弹防御武器主要是陆基的。例如，驻扎在Ft的地基拦截器(GBI)。阿拉斯加的格里利或小牛的范登堡空军基地，将在洲际弹道导弹飞行的中段向太空发射，以拦截攻击导弹。这带来了许多挑战，因为GBIs需要传感器或嵌入式技术，使它们能够区分诱饵和实际的洲际弹道导弹。这就是五角大楼正在出现的下一代拦截器的原因，这种技术旨在探测和摧毁多枚来袭导弹或穿越太空的诱饵。多杀伤车辆，听起来，将多个拦截器集成到一枚导弹上；在洲际弹道导弹旁边飞行的众多诱饵可以增加实际核武器继续", "中文源标题": "F-35可能摧毁敌方洲际弹道导弹", "英文整编": "The U.S. Department of Defense is cooperating with industry to study the F-35 fighter carrying bombs, missiles or laser weapons to detect or destroy the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles (IBCM) in the initial \"boosting\" stage, providing new options for the existing IBCM defense system.

There were highly, highly significant technological breakthroughs here that were assessed and can be used by the air force in its operational systems immediately,” Patel said.\nBoaz Levy, the president and CEO of the Israel Aerospace Industries, which manufactures the Arrow 3, said the breakthroughs were principally in the area of “algorithms,” the ways in which the systems detect incoming threats and calculate launch trajectories for interceptors.\n“I won’t elaborate, but it gives the system more capabilities in dealing with threats,” Levy told reporters.\nThe live-fire test was held over central Israel in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with two Arrow 3 interceptors being fired at the same target.\n“The operational radar arrays of the Arrow system detected the target and sent the data to the fire management system, which analyzed the data and fully plotted the interception. Once the plans were completed, two Arrow 3 interceptors were fired at the target, and they completed their mission successfully,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\nTwo Arrow 3 interceptors are launched during a test of the missile defense system on January 18, 2022. (Defense Ministry)\nLevy said the launching of two interceptors was intentional and planned in advance, not the result of one failing to shoot down the incoming simulated target. He said the two interceptors had “two different missions” in the exercise, having been given two different flight paths to shoot down the same target. “They were carried out exactly as we planned them,” Levy added.\nPatel added that this more closely matches what would happen in an actual barrage and is the first time that two interceptors were launched simultaneously. He refused to comment on the precise altitude at which the interceptors shot down the target, but said it was “deep in space.”\nThe Arrow 3 is currently Israel’s most advanced long-range missile defense system, meant to intercept ballistic missiles while they are still outside of the Earth’s atmosphere, taking out projectiles and their nuclear, biological, chemical or conventional warheads closer to their launch sites. It was developed in a joint project between the Defense Ministry’s Missile Defense Organization and the American Missile Defense Agency. Work is underway on the development of a yet more advanced system, the Arrow 4.\nThe head of the Defense Ministry’s Weapons Development and Technology Infrastructure Administration, Danny Gold, described the test as “a breakthrough that represents a technological leap forward in the capabilities of the defense establishment to renew and to match the emerging threats regionally and on the future battlefield.”\nTuesday’s test followed a number of recent ballistic missile tests by Iran in recent weeks.\nIn an apparent threat to Iran, Defense Minister Benny Gantz said the Arrow test ensured Israel’s ability to take action freely.\n“We are preserving Israel’s ability to defend itself against developing threats in the region and allowing Israel offensive freedom of operation against its enemies, from an understanding that the best defense allows for the most effective attack,” he said.\nTuesday’s test was apparently delayed multiple times, likely due to inclement weather, with the testing area off the coast of central Israel being closed to commercial flights twice over the past week. Patel refused to comment on the reason behind these postponements, saying only that certain safety criteria had not been met.\nThe Arrow 3 was first tested successfully in February 2018, after months of delays and technical problems. It is considered one of the most powerful weapons of its kind in the world and has been in development since 2008.\nComplemented by a number of other missile defense systems designed to protect Israel from short-, medium- and long-range attacks, the Arrow 3 represents the highest level of Israel’s multi-tiered missile defense network.\n", "中文原文": "国防部说，雷达阵列探测到来袭的“目标”，两枚箭3拦截器向其发射，摧毁了它；伊朗最近试射弹道导弹后进行试射作者：犹大·阿里·格罗斯2022年1月18日6:47-上午9:36更新以色列国防部称，周二上午，以色列在地球大气层外成功进行了箭3反弹道导弹系统试验。国防部导弹防御组织负责人摩西·帕特尔（Moshe Patel）周二对记者表示，这次试验测试了导弹防御系统的一些“突破性”能力，以色列空军可以立即使用这些能力。“我们在系统的每个部分都取得了突破，在探测阵列中，在发射中，甚至在拦截器本身中，使它们与该地区预期的威胁相匹配。帕特尔说：“这里有非常非常重要的技术突破，经过评估，空军可以立即在其作战系统中使用。”制造箭3的以色列航空航天工业公司的总裁兼首席执行官波阿斯·利维（Boaz Levy）表示，这些突破主要在“算法”领域，即系统检测来袭威胁和计算拦截器发射轨迹的方式。利维告诉记者：“我不会详细说明，但它赋予了系统更多应对威胁的能力。”实弹测试于周二凌晨在以色列中部举行，两枚箭3拦截弹向同一目标发射。“箭系统的作战雷达阵列探测到目标，并将数据发送到火力管理系统，火力管理系统分析数据并全面绘制拦截图。国防部在一份声明中说：“一旦计划完成，两枚箭3拦截器就向目标发射，它们成功地完成了任务。”2022年1月18日，两枚箭3拦截器在导弹防御系统测试中发射。（国防部）利维说，发射两枚拦截弹是故意的，是事先计划好的，而不是一枚未能击落来袭模拟目标的结果。他说，这两个拦截器在演习中有“两个不同的任务”，被赋予两条不同的飞行路线来击落同一个目标。“他们完全按照我们的计划进行，”利维补充道。帕特尔补充说，这更符合实际弹幕中会发生的情况，也是第一次同时发射两枚拦截弹。他拒绝就拦截器击落目标的精确高度发表评论，但表示目标“在太空深处”。箭3是目前以色列最先进的远程导弹防御系统，旨在拦截仍在地球大气层外的弹道导弹，在靠近发射场的地方取出炮弹及其核、生物、化学或常规弹头。它是在国防部导弹防御组织和美国导弹防御局的一个联合项目中开发的。一个更先进的系统，箭4的开发工作正在进行中。国防部武器发展和技术基础设施管理局局长丹尼·戈尔德（Danny Gold）将这次试验描述为“一项突破，代表了国防机构更新和应对地区和未来战场上新出现的威胁的能力的技术飞跃。”周二的试验是在伊朗最近几周进行了几次弹道导弹试验之后进行的。国防部长本尼·甘茨（Benny Gantz）表示，箭的试验确保了以色列自由采取行动的能力，这显然是对伊朗的威胁。他说：“我们正在维护以色列抵御该地区不断发展的威胁的能力，并允许以色列对其敌人采取进攻性行动的自由，因为我们理解，最好的防御允许最有效的攻击。”周二的测试显然被多次推迟，可能是由于恶劣的天气，以色列中部沿海的测试区在过去一周两次对商业航班关闭。帕特尔拒绝对这些推迟背后的原因发表评论，只是说某些安全标准没有得到满足。经过数月的延迟和技术问题，箭3号于2018年2月首次成功测试。它被认为是世界上同类武器中最强大的武器之一，自2008年以来一直在开发中。箭3是以色列多层导弹防御网络的最高水平，配合其他一些旨在保护以色列免受短程、中程和远程攻击的导弹防御系统。", "中文源标题": "以色列成功试验箭3反弹道导弹系统", "英文整编": "In the early morning of January 18, 2022, local time, Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO) successfully conducted the anti-missile test of Arrow-3 system in central China.

Gen. Gregory M. Guillot in a virtual discussion Jan. 17 hosted by the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance. \n“What I focus on … is advocating for a layered, integrated air and missile defense capability, from the upper tier all the way down to counter-small UAS—a quadcopter flying 50 to 100 feet off the ground at 10 or 20 miles an hour—and everything in between,” Guillot said. \nAir Forces Central commander Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich is responsible for ballistic missile defense and manned air defense in the CENTCOM region, Guillot noted. Individual base commanders are responsible for smaller drones, and Grynkewich and base commanders share responsibility for larger drones. \nWith so many commanders tasked with tracking airborne threats, the goal has been to unite and share data, Guillot said. \n“The way we look to that … is to bring all these different systems that give a commander situational awareness in the missile defense area onto a single pane of glass,” Guillot explained. “And we’re not there yet. We used to be in three or four, maybe five or more buildings on a base with different systems separated. We now have all of the systems in one room—now sometimes it’s on five or six different screens—but all the feeds are at least coming into one room so that the commander can make timely decisions. \n“We’re working to innovate to get it all into one pane of glass [on which] everybody can share all their information.” \nInnovation has become a focus for CENTCOM leaders, driven by commander Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla and a need to do more with less, given that U.S. military strategy and resources have shifted away from the region. And while that push has included experimentation with low-cost drones through the Air Force’s Task Force 99, it’s also required responses to counter Iranian-backed militias, which have launched attacks using explosives strapped to low-cost commercial drones. \n“If you’ve got an Amazon card and access to a hand grenade, you’ve now got an over-the-horizon weapon capability,” said Rear Adm. Curt Renshaw, director of operations for CENTCOM.\nGuillot said such weapons pose a “daily threat.” In September, a USAF F-15 shot down an Iranian drone believed to be a threat to U.S. forces in Iraq. \nMoving forward, Guillot said, the goal is to ensure commanders have the time and options needed to match their response to the threat. \n“I think I would always want more sensing—not necessarily better sensing, and I wouldn’t say that it’s a vulnerability in any way. We have a lot a lot of good sensors,” Guillot said. “But the earlier and the further out you can sense anything gives you more time and more decision space to find the right asset to shoot it down, whether it’s an air-to-air fighter, all the way down to a kinetic or a non-kinetic capability at a base.” \nSpecifically for the counter-UAS mission, officials are trying to increase sensing by using systems already in the region. \n“We’re looking at how do you tune radars to see smaller, slower? And how do you tune these systems to get after the smaller radar cross section type of capabilities at further distances?” said Army Maj. Gen. Sean A. Gainey, director of the Joint C-UAS Office. \nMore sensing will also come from tying more sensors together to present a unified view to commanders, Guillot said. \n“We’re doing a really good job of tying everything from AWACS radars to ground-based radars to very small systems that are designed only for the counter-UAS roles, tying them all into that single pane of glass that I mentioned,” Guillot said. \nCENTCOM has experimental technologies like microwave and directed energy weapons to counter UAS threats, and they are repurposing existing systems, such as the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) Intercept. \nWith the push to innovate and expand capabilities, CENTCOM is helping to lead the way on a new approach to counter-UAS, Gainey said. \n“You can’t look at this fight as a counter-UAS fight and as an integrated air and missile defense fight,” Gainey said. “You’ve got to look at it holistically as an integrated air and missile defense fight.”\n", "中文原文": "2023-1-17官员们说，美国中央司令部在将空中、导弹和无人机防御结合起来方面取得了进展，但要实现“单一玻璃”的集成，还有更多工作要做。中央司令部副司令格雷戈里·吉洛中将（Gregory M.Guillot）在1月17日由导弹防御倡导联盟主办的一次虚拟讨论中表示，充分整合传感器和防御将需要进一步的创新，包括整合新技术和重新利用现有技术。吉尔洛说：“我关注的是……倡导分层、一体化的空中和导弹防御能力，从上层一直到反小型无人机--一种以每小时10或20英里的速度离地50至100英尺的四分机--以及两者之间的一切。”Guillot指出，空军中央指挥官Alexus G.Grynkewich中将负责中央司令部地区的弹道导弹防御和载人防空。单个基地指挥官负责较小的无人机，Grynkewich和基地指挥官共同负责较大的无人机。Guillot说，由于有如此多的指挥官负责跟踪空中威胁，目标是团结和共享数据。“我们对此的看法是……将所有这些不同的系统带到一块玻璃上，让指挥官在导弹防御区了解情况，”吉尔洛解释说。“我们还没有到那一步。我们曾经在一个基地的三四个，也许五个或更多的建筑里，不同的系统被分开。我们现在把所有的系统都放在一个房间里--现在有时它在五六个不同的屏幕上--但所有的馈源至少都进入了一个房间，这样指挥官就可以及时做出决定。“我们正在努力创新，将所有信息都放在一块玻璃上，每个人都可以在上面分享他们的所有信息。”在指挥官迈克尔·埃里克·库里拉将军的推动下，创新已经成为中央司令部领导人的焦点，鉴于美国的军事战略和资源已经从该地区转移，需要少花钱多办事。虽然这一努力包括通过空军99特遣部队进行低成本无人机实验，但也需要做出回应来反击伊朗支持的民兵组织，这些民兵组织使用绑在低成本商业无人机上的炸药发动袭击。“如果你有亚马逊卡和手榴弹，你现在就有了超视距武器能力，”中央司令部运营总监科特·伦肖少将说。吉尔洛说，这种武器构成“每天的威胁”9月，一架美国空军F-15击落了一架被认为对驻伊拉克美军构成威胁的伊朗无人机。Guillot说，前进的目标是确保指挥官有足够的时间和选择来应对威胁。“我想我总是想要更多的感知--不一定是更好的感知，我也不会说这是一个弱点。我们有很多很多好的传感器，“吉尔洛说。“但你能感觉到的东西越早、越远，你就有更多的时间和更大的决策空间来找到合适的资产来击落它，无论是空对空战斗机，还是基地的动能或非动能。”特别是针对反无人机任务，官员们正试图通过使用该地区已经存在的系统来增加感知能力。“我们正在研究如何调整雷达，以看到更小、更慢的雷达？你如何调整这些系统，以在更远的距离上获得更小的雷达散射截面类型的能力？“C-UAS联合办公室主任陆军少将肖恩·A·盖尼说。Guillot说，更多的感知也将来自于将更多的传感器绑在一起，以向指挥官呈现统一的观点。Guillot说：“我们在把从预警机雷达到地基雷达的所有东西都绑定到只为反无人机角色设计的非常小的系统上，把它们都绑定在我提到的一块玻璃上，这方面做得非常好。”CENTCOM拥有微波和定向能武器等实验技术来对抗UAS的威胁，他们正在重新利用现有的系统，如反火箭、火炮、迫击炮（C-RAM）拦截。盖尼说，随着创新和扩大能力的推动，CENTCOM正在帮助引领反无人机的新方法。盖尼说：“你不能把这场战斗视为反无人机战斗，也不能视为综合空中和导弹防御战斗。”“你必须从整体上看，这是一场综合的空中和导弹防御战。”", "中文源标题": "CENTCOM看到集成反无人机和导弹防御系统的成功", "英文整编": "The U.S. Central Command plans to integrate air power, missile and UAV defense systems, and has made some progress, but there is still much work to be done to fully realize single-screen integrated display.

Individual base commanders are responsible for air defense of small UAVs, while Grinkovic and base commanders are jointly responsible for air defense of large UAVs.

Paul Hester said of the Pacific theater. Put more simply, “There’s a lot of room out there,” he said.\nHester has firsthand knowledge of this. He’s a former commander of USAF Pacific Air Forces. Operating effectively in that expansive theater, which will be a major focus of the USAF for the foreseeable future, is why he says re-engining the stealthy, multi-mission F-35A with a next-generation, adaptive powerplant must be part of the USAF’s plans.\nGE’s AETP offering, called the XA100, has delivered on the Air Force’s original ask: 25% better fuel efficiency, twice the thermal management capacity, and at least 10% more thrust. Hester, who now consults for GE, notes the XA100’s three test campaigns—including one currently taking place at the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering Development Complex （AEDC）—have demonstrated that generational jump in capability.\nFrom a mission planning perspective, Hester says the effect such an engine would have in combat would be enormous. “More ‘miles per gallon’ means I can fly that much farther,” he said. “From a mission planner’s point of view, more range means you can complicate your adversary’s problems. Plus, I’m able to react better, with more options, to things that an adversary throws at me.”\n“I’m able to expand my mission and pick different airfields I can operate from. I can take tankers away from contested airspace, and free up their availability for other aircraft that are part of my mission. I’ve opened up my envelope, my operational environment.”\nThe Air Force’s AETP （Adaptive Engine Transition Program）started in 2016 with this exact scenario in mind. General Electric （GE）and Pratt & Whitney are testing engines under this program with adaptive cycle engines that generate more power when you need it and then adapt for greater efficiency while cruising to extend the jet’s range. The AETP engines, designed as drop-in replacement engines for the F-35A, also provide a significant jump in cooling capability. That cooling is critical to support the F-35’s impending Block IV needs and capacity for growth in upcoming upgrades.\nHester notes that’s just the mission flexibility afforded by 25% better fuel efficiency. “That doesn’t account for the other improvements AETP provides,” he says.\nImprovements in thrust and enhanced thermal management bring along similarly important mission benefits. Thrust, Hester notes as a former fighter pilot, “is something you can never get enough of. It increases your potential payload and your ability to get out of challenging situations.”\nThermal management is an area Hester notes is essential for both the short term and long term needs of the F-35 platform.\n“The F-35’s thermal needs are growing,” he said. “And they’ll continue to grow as the jet modernizes throughout its service life. AETP brings double today’s thermal management capacity, which means plenty of cooling availability to absorb heat off various internal systems. The three-stream architecture AETP introduces, as opposed to the current two-stream architecture, is the key to solving the overheating problems we see today.”\nImprovements in model-based systems engineering in recent years have also helped model the design and predict performance of GE’s XA100. Today’s tests of a physical engine are proving the accuracy of pre-test modeling and predictions.\n“[The XA100] has tested at Air Force facilities in Tullahoma, Tennessee,” Hester said. “Through those tests, you’re able to look against the predicted ability of the engine to operate across the flight envelope and see where the actual data points are.”\nThe tests at AEDC are part of a long-term risk mitigation strategy Hester says the Air Force was wise to employ. “There is always a learning curve with jet engine development and design, whether it’s a new engine or an upgrade. But the way the Air Force structured its adaptive engine programs, methodically working through multiple programs and providing consistent funding for those programs, has allowed a significant amount of risk to be removed. That allows the Air Force to know what they’re getting before an Engineering and Manufacturing Development program.”\nDigital engineering also has given GE the confidence that its engine fits not just the AETP target design vehicle in the F-35A, but also the carrier-based F-35C. GE has a part-number common engine for both aircraft, representing nearly 90% of the planned F-35 fleet.\n“The most advanced aircraft in the world should have an engine to match,” Hester said. “The benefits are clear, and we need to move forward now to outpace an increasingly competitive environment.”\n", "中文原文": "2022年8月9日，尼克·阿德退休的美国空军将军保罗·赫斯特（Paul Hester）在谈到太平洋战区时说：“如果你要提供一支能够有效飞行并在那种环境下完成任务的空军，你必须解决很多问题。”更简单地说，“外面有很大的空间，”他说。海丝特对此有第一手资料。他是美国空军太平洋空军的前指挥官。在这个广阔的战区有效运作，这将是美国空军在可预见的未来的主要焦点，这就是为什么他说，用下一代自适应动力装置重新制造隐身、多任务F-35A必须是美国空军计划的一部分。通用电气的AETP产品被称为XA100，满足了空军最初的要求：提高25%的燃油效率，两倍的热管理能力，至少增加10%的推力。赫斯特现在是通用电气的顾问，他指出，XA100的三次测试活动--包括目前在空军阿诺德工程开发中心(AEDC)进行的一次--已经证明了一代人能力的飞跃。从任务规划的角度来看，赫斯特说，这样的发动机在战斗中的效果将是巨大的。“更多的‘每加仑英里数’意味着我可以飞得更远，”他说。“从任务规划者的角度来看，更大的射程意味着你可以使对手的问题复杂化。此外，我能够对对手扔给我的东西做出更好的反应，有更多的选择。““我能够扩大我的任务，选择不同的机场。我可以把加油机从有争议的空域带走，并为我任务中的其他飞机腾出空位。我打开了我的信封，我的操作环境。“空军的AETP（自适应发动机过渡计划）始于2016年，正是考虑到了这一确切的场景。通用电气（GE）和普惠公司（Pratt&Whitney）正在测试该项目下的发动机，这些发动机在需要时产生更多功率，然后在巡航时适应更高的效率，以扩大飞机的航程。AETP发动机设计为F-35A的插入替代发动机，也提供了冷却能力的显著提高。这种冷却对于支持F-35即将到来的Block IV需求和即将到来的升级中的增长能力至关重要。赫斯特指出，这只是25%的燃油效率提高所提供的任务灵活性。“这并不能解释AETP提供的其他改进，”他说。推力的改进和热管理的加强带来了同样重要的任务好处。作为一名前战斗机飞行员，海丝特指出，推力“是一种你永远得不到的东西。它增加了您的潜在有效载荷和摆脱挑战性情况的能力。“热管理是一个领域，赫斯特指出，对于F-35平台的短期和长期需求都是必不可少的。“F-35的热需求正在增长，”他说。“随着喷气式飞机在整个使用寿命中的现代化，它们将继续增长。AETP带来了双倍今天的热管理能力，这意味着大量的冷却可用性，以吸收热量从各种内部系统。AETP引入的三流体系结构，与目前的两流体系结构相反，是解决我们今天看到的过热问题的关键。“近年来，基于模型的系统工程的改进也有助于建立通用电气XA100的设计模型和预测性能。今天对物理引擎的测试证明了测试前建模和预测的准确性。“[XA100]已经在田纳西州图拉霍马的空军设施进行了测试，”赫斯特说。“通过这些测试，你能够对照发动机在飞行包线上运行的预测能力，并看到实际数据点在哪里。”AEDC的测试是长期风险缓解战略的一部分，赫斯特说空军使用是明智的。“喷气发动机的开发和设计总是有一个学习曲线，无论是新发动机还是升级。但是空军构建其自适应发动机项目的方式，有条不紊地通过多个项目工作，并为这些项目提供持续的资金，已经允许消除大量风险。这使得空军能够在工程和制造发展计划之前知道他们得到了什么。“数字工程也给了通用电气信心，它的发动机不仅适合F-35A中的AETP目标设计车辆，也适合舰载F-35C。通用电气为两架飞机配备了部分编号的通用发动机，占计划中F-35机队的近90%。“世界上最先进的飞机应该有一个发动机匹配，”赫斯特说。“好处很明显，我们现在需要向前迈进，以超越竞争日益激烈的环境。”", "中文源标题": "通用电气公司的XA100发动机将为F-35创造新的任务可能性", "英文整编": "\"If you are going to provide an Air Force that can fly effectively and complete its mission in that environment, you have to solve a lot of problems,\" retired U.S. Air Force Admiral Paul Hearst said of the Pacific theater. \"To put it more simply, there is a lot of space there.\"Hearst has first-hand knowledge of this. He is a former commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific Theater. Operating effectively on the vast battlefield will be the main concern of the US Air Force in the foreseeable future, which is why he said that replacing the F-35A with the next generation adaptive power plant must be part of the US Air Force plan.GE's AETP engine XA100 has met the original requirements of the US Air Force: fuel efficiency improvement of 25%, thermal management capability doubling, and thrust increase of at least 10%. Hurst, who is now a consultant at GE, points out that three test events for the XA100-including one currently conducted at the Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC)-have demonstrated this generational jump in capability.With this AETP engine, the F-35A can have a longer range, expand its mission, have greater operational flexibility, keep tankers out of disputed airspace, and make room for other aircraft in its mission. Open the area restriction and expand the combat environment.The Air Force's AETP (Adaptive Engine Transition Program) was launched in 2016, precisely because of this consideration. GE and Pratt & Whitney are testing the adaptive cycle engine under this project. AETP engine is an alternative engine designed for F-35A, and its cooling capacity is also greatly improved. This cooling is essential to support the F-35's upcoming Block IV demand and future upgrades in its growth capabilities.Hearst pointed out that this is only the task flexibility brought by the 25% increase in fuel efficiency, not counting other improvements provided by AETP. The improvement of thrust and the strengthening of thermal management bring equally important mission benefits. Thermal management is crucial to the short-term and long-term requirements of the F-35. Because the thermal management demand of F-35 is growing and will continue to grow. AETP's thermal management capacity is twice as high as it is today, meaning there is enough cooling capacity to absorb heat from various internal systems.Recent improvements in model-based systems engineering have also contributed to the design modeling and performance prediction of GE XA100. Today's engine physics test proves the accuracy of pre-test modeling and prediction. Testing at AEDC is part of a long-term risk mitigation strategy, and Hearst believes the Air Force is wise to adopt this strategy: \"There is always a learning curve in the development and design of jet engines, whether it is a new engine or an upgraded engine. But the way the Air Force organizes its adaptive engine projects, methodically completing multiple projects and providing consistent funding for these projects, has allowed a large number of risks to be eliminated. This enables the Air Force to know what they will get before engineering and manufacturing development projects.\"Digital engineering also gives GE confidence that its engine is not only suitable for F-35A designed by AETP target, but also suitable for shipborne F-35C. GE provides a common part number engine for both aircraft, accounting for nearly 90% of the planned F-35 fleet."}, {"中文标题": "朝鲜再次成功发射“火星-15”洲际弹道导弹   ", "情报来源": "韩联社", "时间": "2023年2月18日", "整编内容": "朝鲜当地时间2月18日17点20分左右，朝鲜在平壤国际机场高角度成功再次发射1枚“火星-15”洲际弹道导弹。朝鲜媒体表示，朝鲜本次发射是一次“突击”演习的一部分，其目的旨在再次确认和验证武器系统的机动和强大的反击能力和可靠性，同时凸显朝鲜核武战备状态。\n据朝鲜媒体报道，此次发射未提前计划，而是按照朝鲜领导人金正恩2月17日凌晨发布了模拟“紧急火力战斗待命命令”的紧急指示，以及当天上午金正恩下达的命令书紧急组织进行的。本次试验中，“火星-15”导弹最大高度5768.5千米，飞行距离989千米，飞行时间约4015秒（67分），并精确打击了位于朝鲜东部公海的目标水域，在本次发射评估中获得“优异的成绩”。\n朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副部长金与正19日发表谈话，抨击美国和韩国打着应对威胁的招牌大肆叫嚣扩张遏制力。金与正警告，朝方将密切关注敌人的一举一动，并将做出“与之相应的、强有力的压倒性应对”。\n美韩2月1日举行了今年首次联合空中演习，22日将再次举行空中演习，3月中旬还将举行代号为“自由护盾”的联合军演。\n韩国联合参谋本部19日表示，韩美当天在朝鲜半岛上空实施了联合空演，并投入了美国战略武器。此次演习的内容是，韩国空军F-35A和F-15K战斗机、美国空军F-16战机，为进入韩国防空识别区的美军B-1B战略轰炸机进行护航并实施联合编队飞行。10余架两国战斗机参演，这些战机从半岛西部海域穿越南部地区飞往东部海域。\n韩国联合参谋本部表示，此次演习通过及时迅速调遣美国延伸威慑战斗力，展现了韩美同盟依据压倒性战力的联防能力和态势。\n针对美韩19日开展的联合军演，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副部长金与正19日还发表谈话称，美国和韩国动辄打出应对威胁之招牌，大肆喧嚷扩张遏制力和联合防卫态势，公开暴露出要在朝鲜半岛地区取得军事优势、占据支配地位的十分危险、极为过度的野心和企图，这将越来越破坏地区稳定，导致形势岌岌可危。\n金与正还受委托警告称：“我们将密切关注敌人的一举一动。针对我们的敌对行为，每次将予以与之相应的、强有力的压倒性应对。”\n本次发射是火星-15导弹开展的第二次飞行试验，2017年11月29日，朝鲜由平安南道平城市一带向朝鲜半岛东部海域方向首次发射1枚“火星-15”远程弹道导弹，飞行距离约950km，最大高度约4475km，飞行约53分钟后，落入日本海，飞行试验取得圆满成功。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "北京航天长征科技信息研究所", "源网址": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/18/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "源标题": "North Korea says it tested ICBM in surprise drill ", "原文": "Kim Yo Jong threatens ‘overwhelming response’ to hostility after test of new missile unit’s readiness\nColin ZwirkoFebruary 19, 2023\nSHARE\nA state media image of the Hwasong-15 ICBM launching from a dedicated mobile launch vehicle on Feb. 18 | Image: Rodong Sinmun (Feb. 19, 2023)\nNorth Korea launched a Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) onSaturdayas a warning to the U.S. and South Korea and to test the readiness of special units under the military’s new Missile General Bureau, according to state media.\nTheKorean Central News Agency(KCNA)reportedSunday that the launch ordered on short notice proves the reliability of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and “capacity for fatal nuclear counterattack on the hostile forces,” stating “military threats of the U.S. and south Korea are getting serious to the extent that can not be overlooked.”\nKim Yo Jong, sister of DPRK leader Kim Jong Un, also warned Seoul and Washington of an “overwhelming response” to perceived “hostility” in a separate statementreleasedbyKCNAon Sunday.\nSunday’s warnings came days after a foreign ministry spokespersonthreatened“unprecedented” counteractions if the U.S. and South Korea carry out large-scale joint drills in the coming weeks as planned.\nMore images published Sunday of the previous day’s Hwasong-15 ICBM launch | Images: KCNA (Feb. 19, 2023)\nICBM LAUNCH\nKCNA reported that the First Red Flag Hero Company launched the ICBM on Saturday from Pyongyang International Airport and that it accurately struck a target area in international waters in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) around 614 miles (989 km) away, reaching a maximum altitude of around 3,584 miles (5,768 km) and flying for 66 minutes total.\nThis roughly matches flight datapublished earlierby the South Korean and Japanese militaries, which said the missile launched around 5:22 p.m. KST and flew 560 miles.

The content of this exercise is that Korean Air Force F-35A and F-15K fighters and American Air Force F-16 fighters escort American B-1B strategic bombers entering the Korean Air Defense Identification Zone and carry out joint formation flight. More than 10 fighters from the two countries participated, and these fighters flew from the western waters of the peninsula to the eastern waters through the southern region.South Korea's Joint Staff Headquarters said that the exercise demonstrated the joint defense capability and situation of the ROK-US alliance based on overwhelming combat power by promptly dispatching the United States to extend its deterrent combat effectiveness.In response to the joint military exercise conducted by the United States and South Korea on the 19th, Jin Yuzheng, deputy director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, also made a speech on the 19th, saying that the United States and South Korea frequently put up the signboard of dealing with threats, clamored for expansion of containment and joint defense posture, and publicly exposed the very dangerous and excessive ambition and attempt to gain military superiority and occupy a dominant position in the Korean Peninsula, which will increasingly undermine regional stability and lead to a precarious situation.Jin Yuzheng was also entrusted to warn: \"We will pay close attention to every move of the enemy. In response to our hostile acts, we will give corresponding and strong overwhelming response every time.\"This launch is the second flight test of Mars-15 missile. On November 29, 2017, North Korea launched a \"Mars-15\" long-range ballistic missile for the first time from Pingcheng, South Pyongan Province, to the eastern waters of the Korean Peninsula, with a flight distance of about 950km and a maximum altitude of about 4,475km.

(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)\nWASHINGTON — The Department of Defense is looking to industry for nuclear-powered propulsion technology to drive its spacecraft, freeing them from the low-energy limitations of current electric and solar-based propulsion systems.\nThose traditional systems have largely served government space systems well. Once they reach their intended orbit, most satellites don’t need to move very much. Propulsion systems are generally used to readjust satellite positions when they drift out of their assigned position or to avoid collisions, while occasionally transporting those satellites to new orbits to continue their mission.\nHowever, future U.S. military missions may require much more maneuverability and power. Future U.S. missions will need more electrical power to more frequently change orbits, transfer other objects to new orbits and operate beyond Earth’s orbit, according to a Sept. 9 solicitation from the Defense Innovation Unit, a DoD organization that helps match mature, commercial solutions to military needs.\nMoreover, the shrinking size of many space systems driven by the increased capabilities of small satellites and cubesats imposes volume constraints on future propulsion systems. In other words, the military wants more power, but not by simply building bigger propulsion systems or adding more solar panels.\nTo that end, DIU’s government customers are looking for lightweight, long-lasting commercial nuclear power solutions that can provide greater propulsion and electric power for small and medium-sized spacecraft. Interested companies that can show a plan for prototype development within three to five years could be awarded other transaction authority contracts to support laboratory-based prototyping of such systems, followed by a path to flight-based testing. Responses to the solicitation are due no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on Sept. 23.\nThis isn’t the military’s first time dipping its toe into developing nuclear-powered spacecraft. Most recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency issued contracts to three companies in April to design a nuclear thermal propulsion system for space. The program, known as the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations, seeks to build nuclear thermal propulsion that can enable rapid maneuver in space, particularly for cislunar operations.\nGeneral Atomics, Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin are the prime contractors on that effort.\nMeanwhile, companies are beginning to offer commercial services that can refuel satellites or supplement them with their own propulsion systems. SpaceLogistics, for example, introduced a Mission Extension Vehicle that can latch onto a customer’s satellite on orbit and then maneuver it around with it’s own propulsion system. Orbit Fab, which recently saw investments from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, is building gas stations on orbit. These efforts provide another option for getting more maneuverability and service life out of existing propulsion systems.\n", "中文原文": "桑德拉·欧文-2021年9月11日一个火星过境栖息地和核推进系统的插图。信用：NASA国防创新部门的一项新的征集活动寻求“能够在近期提供动力和推进的成熟商业技术”华盛顿--国防创新部门上周发布了一项关于用于地球轨道以外太空任务的小型核动力发动机的招标。征集活动称，国防部希望“轻量级、便携式和长时间的电源，可以支持中小型航天器上的推进和传感和通信的站上电源”。DIU说，电力和太阳能推进系统不适合地球轨道以外的任务，而且太大了，不适用于现代商业航天器。“在保持燃料效率的同时，需要先进的推进技术来实现国防部在太空中的新任务集。”提交时间为9月23日。DIU可以在60到90天内授予合同。这些将是基于实验室的原型测试的“其他交易”合同。根据OT奖，公司和政府同意投资该项目。投标人必须显示“可信的制造、监管和许可途径，在三到五年内实现原型开发，以及后续的基于飞行的测试。”美国宇航局和国防高级研究计划局目前正在资助基于裂变的推进和动力的发展，如核热推进技术。DIU说，它没有重复现有的项目，而是寻求用“成熟的商业技术支持当前的政府项目，这些技术可以在短期内提供动力和推进。”确保这些系统是安全的是另一个问题。DIU希望系统能够“最大限度地减少航天器集成过程中对地面人员的辐射暴露和对周围电子部件的辐射暴露。”同类文章作者NathanStrout9月11日02:47上午DARPA认为，核动力推进可以在太空中实现快速机动--这是目前电力和化学推进系统难以实现的能力。（国防高级研究计划局）华盛顿--国防部正在向工业界寻求核动力推进技术来驱动其航天器，使其摆脱目前电力和太阳能推进系统的低能耗限制。这些传统系统在很大程度上很好地服务于政府空间系统。一旦它们到达预定轨道，大多数卫星不需要移动太多。推进系统通常用于在卫星偏离其指定位置时重新调整其位置或避免碰撞，同时偶尔将这些卫星运送到新的轨道以继续其任务。然而，美国未来的军事任务可能需要更多的机动性和力量。根据国防部组织国防创新股9月9日的一项征集，未来的美国任务将需要更多的电力来更频繁地改变轨道，将其他物体转移到新的轨道，并在地球轨道之外运行。国防创新股是一个帮助将成熟的商业解决方案与军事需求相匹配的组织。此外，由于小型卫星和立方体卫星能力的增强，许多空间系统的规模不断缩小，这对未来的推进系统造成了体积限制。换句话说，军方想要更多的电力，但不是简单地建造更大的推进系统或增加更多的太阳能电池板。为此，DIU的政府客户正在寻找轻质、持久的商业核能解决方案，可以为中小型航天器提供更大的推进力和电力。如果有兴趣的公司能够在三到五年内展示原型开发计划，可以获得其他交易授权合同，以支持此类系统的实验室原型制作，然后进行飞行测试。对征集的回应应不迟于美国东部时间9月23日晚上11:59。这不是军方第一次涉足发展核动力航天器。最近，国防高级研究计划局在4月份向三家公司发布了设计太空核热推进系统的合同。该项目被称为“灵巧四轮飞船行动示范火箭”，旨在建造能够在太空中快速机动的核热推进装置，特别是用于四轮飞船行动。通用原子公司、蓝色起源公司和洛克希德·马丁公司是这项工作的主要承包商。与此同时，公司开始提供商业服务，可以为卫星加油，或者用自己的推进系统补充卫星。例如，SpaceLogistics推出了一种任务扩展飞行器，它可以在轨道上锁定客户的卫星，然后用它自己的推进系统操纵它。眼眶Fa", "中文源标题": "五角大楼为其卫星的核动力推进技术开发工业", "英文整编": "On September 9th, the Defense Innovation Team (DIU) of the US Department of Defense issued a tender for \"small nuclear-powered engines for space missions beyond Earth orbit\".

The companies did not disclose terms of the launch deal or where the launch, using Virgin Orbit’s LauncherOne air-launch system, will take place.\nNorthStar announced in March a contract with Spire for those three satellites, part of Spire’s “space as a service” business model where it builds and operates satellites for other customers in addition to those for its own constellation. Spire announced Oct. 12 a launch agreement with Virgin Orbit covering multiple LauncherOne missions over several years, starting 2023.\n“We’re proud that NorthStar is leveraging our space services model and established space, ground, and web infrastructure to rapidly deploy its constellation,” Joel Sparks, co-founder and general manager for space services at Spire, said in a statement.\nThe satellites are the first in a constellation of 24 spacecraft planned by NorthStar to collect commercial SSA data. NorthStar plans to place the satellites into eight orbital planes of three satellites each, scanning out from low Earth orbit to track satellites and debris.

Industrial gas separation technologies widely use this principle, often relying on polymer membranes with different porosity. There is always a trade-off between the accuracy of separation and its efficiency: the finer you adjust the pore sizes, the less gas flow such sieves allow.\nIt has long been speculated that, using two-dimensional membranes similar in thickness to graphene, one can reach much better trade-offs than currently achievable because, unlike conventional membranes, atomically thin ones should allow easier gas flows for the same selectivity.\nNow a research team led by Professor Sir Andre Geim at The University of Manchester, in collaboration with scientists from Belgium and China, have used low-energy electrons to punch individual atomic-scale holes in suspended graphene. The holes came in sizes down to about two angstroms, smaller than even the smallest atoms such as helium and hydrogen.\nIn December's issue of Nature Communications, the researchers report that they achieved practically perfect selectivity (better than 99.9%) for such gases as helium or hydrogen with respect to nitrogen, methane or xenon. Also, air molecules (oxygen and nitrogen) pass through the pores easily relative to carbon dioxide, which is >95% captured.\nThe scientists point out that to make two-dimensional membranes practical, it is essential to find atomically thin materials with intrinsic pores, that is, pores within the crystal lattice itself.\n\"Precision sieves for gases are certainly possible and, in fact, they are conceptually not dissimilar to those used to sieve sand and granular materials. However, to make this technology industrially relevant, we need membranes with densely spaced pores, not individual holes created in our study to prove the concept for the first time. Only then are the high flows required for industrial gas separation achievable,\" says Dr. Pengzhan Sun, a lead author of the paper.\nThe research team now plans to search for such two-dimensional materials with large intrinsic pores to find those most promising for future gas separation technologies. Such materials do exist. For example, there are various graphynes, which are also atomically thin allotropes of carbon but not yet manufactured at scale. These look like graphene but have larger carbon rings, similar in size to the individual defects created and studied by the Manchester researchers. The right size may make graphynes perfectly suited for gas separation.\n", "中文原文": "曼彻斯特大学的研究人员发现，通过在原子级薄膜上制造原子级孔洞，应该有可能制造用于精确和高效气体分离的分子筛，包括从空气中提取二氧化碳。如果膜中的孔径与原子和分子的大小相当，它们可以穿过膜，也可以被排斥，从而根据它们的分子直径来分离气体。工业气体分离技术广泛应用这一原理，往往依赖于不同孔隙率的聚合物膜。在分离的精确度和效率之间总是有一个权衡：你调整的孔径越细，这样的筛子允许的气体流量就越少。长期以来，人们一直猜测，使用厚度与石墨烯相似的二维膜，可以实现比目前更好的权衡，因为与传统膜不同，原子薄的膜应该允许气体更容易地流动，以获得相同的选择性。现在，曼彻斯特大学安德烈·海姆爵士教授领导的一个研究小组与比利时和中国的科学家合作，使用低能电子在悬浮石墨烯上打出单个原子级的空穴。这些空穴的大小缩小到大约两埃，甚至比氦和氢等最小的原子还要小。在12月的《自然通讯》杂志上，研究人员报告说，他们对氦或氢相对于氮、甲烷或氙的选择性达到了几乎完美的（优于99.9%）。此外，空气分子（氧和氮）相对于二氧化碳容易通过孔隙，二氧化碳被捕获超过95%。科学家们指出，要使二维薄膜实用，必须找到具有内在孔隙的原子薄材料，即晶格内部的孔隙。“精确的气体筛当然是可能的，事实上，它们在概念上与用来筛沙子和颗粒材料的筛没有什么不同。然而，为了使这项技术与工业相关，我们需要具有密集孔隙的膜，而不是在我们的研究中创建的单个孔来首次证明这一概念。只有这样，工业气体分离所需的高流量才是可以实现的，”该论文的主要作者孙鹏展博士说。研究小组现在计划寻找这种具有大内在孔隙的二维材料，以找到那些最有希望用于未来气体分离技术的材料。这样的材料确实存在。例如，有各种各样的石墨，它们也是原子上薄的碳同素异形体，但尚未大规模生产。它们看起来像石墨烯，但有更大的碳环，大小与曼彻斯特研究人员创建和研究的单个缺陷相似。合适的尺寸可以使葡萄完全适合气体分离。", "中文源标题": "石墨烯原子孔中气体的精密筛分", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at Manchester University in England have successfully manufactured atomic-level holes in atomic-level films, which can be used to accurately screen gases.

Mobile microwave, communications, telemetry and camera footage are run from the floating test center.\nAn A-10C Thunderbolt II from the 23rd Fighter Group performs a show-of-force maneuver during a training exercise,\nAn important portion of the 96th OSS’s coordination for this giant exercise is approvals and funding to execute specific requirements. For this exercise, the base safety office and the 96 TW had to approve releasing live munitions into the Gulf of Mexico. Once approvals are granted and the mission is funding, the scheduling begins.\nThis includes range times, aircraft flights, marine operations, weather, and much more. Once the aircraft arrives, the 96th OSS support them throughout the entire mission. They handle bed down, ground equipment, radios, office space, and air traffic control before, during, and after the exercise.\nDuring the exercise, the 96th Range Control Squadron takes over. The squadron manages the central control facility where the entire mission is controlled. CCF personnel ensures communications between test directors, controllers, air traffic control, and aircrew. They also ensure mission video and data sent to the CCF are displayed for real-time viewing and data collection.\nThe 96th TW’s efforts are executed by military, civilians, and heavily by contracted employees with more than 12,000 hours of support during this maritime WSEP.\n", "中文原文": "在埃尔斯沃思空军基地，一架B-1轰炸机在使用全加力燃烧室的情况下从跑道上起飞（美国空军照片）美国空军第53武器评估小组在2022年4月7日至15日期间进行了最大规模的海上武器系统评估计划。美国空军新闻稿这种迭代包括空对空、空对地和电子战行动。第74战斗机中队和第422测试和评估中队的A-10参加了作战演习，并接受了针对海上目标的特立独行和激光制导武器能力的评估。这是一个极其难得的机会，因为有真正海上目标的实景空对地武器射程是不常见的。在几种战术环境中，海上目标是预期的，能够迅速起诉其中的许多目标对几个战斗指挥官来说是重要的。“--少校。兰德尔·奥特，第59届TES项目经理在WSEP的战斗锤（空对地）部分，第1特种作战联队的U-28飞机协助目标捕获。第34轰炸中队的B-1枪骑兵也参加了战斗锤子部分。第12和第3特种作战中队的MQ-9收割者被用来部署最少的设备和人员来执行行动。在坎农空军基地，一架MQ-9收割者在首次飞行表演中执行低传（美国空军照片）所有这些飞机和任务集都使用Eglin的许多水域、空域和环境来执行评估。这些靶场由第96测试联队的靶场组负责。活动和空域的计划管理属于第96作战支援中队。计划在活动前几个月开始，开始协调飞机和武器的类型和数量、目标要求、空域等。协调员与靶场工作人员合作，储备必要的海洋设备，包括海湾靶场武器测试船。这是一艘部署在墨西哥湾测试区的驳船，装载了设备和操作设备所需的24人。移动微波、通信、遥测和摄像镜头从浮动测试中心运行。第23战斗机群的A-10C雷电II在训练演习中进行武力机动表演，第96届开放源码软件对这一巨大演习的协调的一个重要部分是执行特定要求的批准和资金。为了这次演习，基地安全办公室和96 TW必须批准向墨西哥湾释放实弹。一旦获得批准，特派团获得资金，日程安排就开始了。这包括航程时间、飞机飞行、海上作业、天气等等。一旦飞机到达，第96开放源码软件在整个任务中支持他们。他们在演习之前、期间和之后处理卧床、地面设备、无线电、办公空间和空中交通管制。在演习中，第96靶场控制中队接管。中队管理中央控制设施，在那里控制整个任务。CCF人员确保测试主管、管制员、空中交通管制和机组人员之间的通信。它们还确保发送到CCF的任务视频和数据显示出来，以便实时查看和数据收集。第96 TW的努力是由军事、平民和大量合同雇员执行的，在这次海上WSEP期间，他们有超过12000个小时的支持。", "中文源标题": "美国空军对海上武器进行最大规模评估", "英文整编": "From April 7 to 15, 2022, the 53rd Weapon Assessment Team of the US Air Force conducted the largest assessment of maritime weapon systems using the sea and airspace shooting ranges of Eglin Air Force Base, including air-to-air, air-to-ground and electronic warfare operations.

The smallest ones, only a few nanometers wide, are also crucial for drug delivery, sensors and quantum computer processors. Producing diamond nanoparticles that are consistently sized is important to the success of these technologies. Now, scientists report a method to grow ultra-uniform nanodiamonds without the need for explosives. The technique also could be used to add beneficial single-atom defects in otherwise perfect crystals.\nThe researchers will present their results today at the spring meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS).\n\"It's fascinating that although a diamond is chemically rather simple—it is one element, carbon—making this material at the nanometer scale is extremely difficult,\" says Hao Yan, Ph.D., the project's principal investigator.\nCarbon becomes a diamond when atoms of this element are arranged into a rigid 3D cubic pattern under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Researchers previously have created nanodiamonds in the lab by detonating an explosive, such as trinitrotoluene (known as TNT), in a sealed stainless-steel container. The blast converts the carbon in the explosive material into tiny diamond particles. However, this crude method is hard to control, explains Yan. The crystals that form are uneven in size, requiring additional steps to sort them for different technologies.\nTo devise a more precise way to make nanodiamonds, Yan's group at the University of North Texas looked into the chemistry that nature uses. \"We realized that places where diamonds are formed in the Earth's mantle contain a lot of iron and iron-carbon compounds, including carbides and carbonates,\" Yan says. And when iron carbide reacts withiron oxidebetween the crust and theupper mantle, diamonds grow.\nArmed with this knowledge, Tengteng Lyu, a graduate student in Yan's lab who is presenting their work at the meeting, designed a chemical process to imitate the lithospheric environment found below Earth's surface. First, Lyu created evenly sized nanoparticles of iron carbide as thecarbon sourcefor the diamonds. The tiny particles were dotted throughout an iron oxide matrix, as though the iron carbide were chocolate chips within cookie dough.\nThen, Lyu placed the carbon-precursor \"dough\" in a high-pressure and high-temperature environment, similar to the conditions at locations where natural diamonds form. The compounds reacted, and very uniform nanodiamonds resulted. The new method makes crystals as small as 2 nm wide with differences between them of less than a nanometer. Yan says that this is one order of magnitude better than anyone can do without additional post-synthetic treatment or purification steps.\nCreating uniform, perfect nanodiamonds is great, says Yan, but these materials can be even more useful when they have defects, such as empty spots in the diamond's structure and the replacement of neighboring carbon atoms with nitrogen, silicon, nickel or another element. Because the non-carbon atomscolor the material slightly, they are called \"color centers.\" Nanoparticles with only one color center are highly desirable because they can securely store information in quantum computers and telecommunication devices.\nTraditionally, a high-energy beam of atoms, such as nitrogen or silicon, is used to bombard the diamond and embed these elements in the crystal's structure. However, this method cannot control how manycolor centersare added to one diamond, requiring post-processing steps to get crystals with a single-atom defect. In addition, according to Lyu's extensive computational modeling work, when the diameters of diamonds shrink to 2-3 nm—the size range that Yan's team can now make consistently—this atom beam approach becomes energetically unfavorable. But with their new method, Yan thinks they could design a way to replace one carbon of the thousands present in their carbon-precursor \"dough.\" He estimates that they could now make enough single-color center nanodiamonds for a couple thousand quantum computers with one synthesis experiment, though the tiny crystals would need to be arranged properly before computations could be made.\n\"We now have an ideal platform to devise a way for making a single-color center nanodiamond, which is a breakthrough for a number of diamond-related technologies. But also, in a broader sense, it would be a fascinating demonstration of how you can control a single atom in a much larger structure,\" says Yan.\n", "中文原文": "钻石不仅仅是闪闪发光的珠宝。最小的只有几纳米宽，对药物输送、传感器和量子计算机处理器也至关重要。生产尺寸一致的金刚石纳米颗粒对这些技术的成功至关重要。现在，科学家报告了一种不需要炸药就能生长超均匀纳米钻石的方法。该技术也可用于在其他完美晶体中添加有益的单原子缺陷。研究人员将在今天的美国化学学会(ACS)春季会议上展示他们的结果。“令人着迷的是，尽管钻石在化学上相当简单--它是一种元素，但碳--在纳米尺度上制造这种材料极其困难，”该项目的首席研究员郝岩博士说。当碳元素的原子在高压和高温条件下排列成刚性的三维立方图案时，碳就变成了金刚石。此前，研究人员在实验室通过在密封的不锈钢容器中引爆三硝基甲苯（即TNT）等炸药来制造纳米钻石。爆炸将爆炸材料中的碳转化为微小的金刚石颗粒。然而，这种粗糙的方法很难控制，严解释说。形成的晶体大小不均匀，需要额外的步骤来根据不同的技术对它们进行分类。为了设计一种更精确的方法来制造纳米钻石，北德克萨斯大学的严的团队研究了自然界使用的化学物质。“我们意识到地幔中形成钻石的地方含有大量的铁和铁碳化合物，包括碳化物和碳酸盐，”严说。当碳化铁与地壳和上地幔之间的氧化铁发生反应时，金刚石就生长出来了。颜氏实验室的研究生Tenteng Lyu利用这些知识，设计了一种化学方法来模仿地球表面下发现的岩石圈环境。他正在会议上展示他们的工作。首先，Lyu制造了均匀尺寸的纳米碳化铁颗粒，作为钻石的碳化物来源。微小的颗粒点缀在氧化铁基质中，就像碳化铁是饼干面团中的巧克力片一样。然后，Lyu将碳前驱体“面团”置于高压高温环境中，类似于天然钻石形成的条件。这些化合物发生反应，生成了非常均匀的纳米金刚石。新的方法使晶体小到2纳米宽，它们之间的差异小于一纳米。严说，这比没有额外的合成后处理或纯化步骤的任何人都要好一个数量级。严说，制造均匀、完美的纳米钻石很棒，但当这些材料有缺陷时，它们可能会更有用，比如钻石结构中的空点，以及用氮、硅、镍或其他元素取代邻近的碳原子。因为非碳原子使材料略微着色，所以它们被称为“色心”。只有一个色心的纳米粒子是非常理想的，因为它们可以在量子计算机和通信设备中安全地存储信息。传统上，高能原子束，如氮或硅，被用来轰击钻石，并将这些元素嵌入晶体结构中。然而，这种方法不能控制多个颜色中心如何添加到一颗钻石上，需要经过后处理才能得到具有单原子缺陷的晶体。此外，根据Lyu的大量计算建模工作，当金刚石的直径缩小到2-3纳米--严的团队现在可以一致地做出的尺寸范围--这种原子束方法在能量上变得不利。但是有了他们的新方法，严认为他们可以设计出一种方法来取代他们的碳前体“面团”中存在的数千种碳中的一种。他估计，通过一次合成实验，他们现在可以制造出足够几千台量子计算机使用的单色中心纳米钻石，尽管在进行计算之前，微小的晶体需要正确排列。“我们现在有了一个理想的平台来设计制造单色中心纳米金刚石的方法，这是许多金刚石相关技术的突破。但从更广泛的意义上说，这将是一个迷人的演示，展示了如何在更大的结构中控制单个原子，”严说。", "中文源标题": "生长极其微小、尺寸均匀的钻石--没有炸药", "英文整编": "Researchers at the University of North Texas in the United States have designed a method to grow ultra-uniform nano-diamonds without using explosives by using chemicals existing in nature.

At the same time, researchers can replace one of thousands of carbon atoms in the carbon precursor \"dough\" with nitrogen, silicon, nickel or other elements to produce nano-diamond particles with monochromatic centers, which is very important for their applications in advanced sensors, quantum computers and other fields."}, {"中文标题": "改进树脂3D打印的新型金属偏振片技术", "情报来源": "3dprintingindustry网站", "时间": "2022年2月8日", "整编内容": "美国的一个联合研究团队正在进行基于树脂3D打印机的金属线栅偏振滤光片方面的研究。线栅偏振片旨在取代单色LCD屏幕中使用的传统PVA薄膜偏振片，该组件会生成用于打印各个层的图案。早期测试表明，与类似的薄膜材料相比，新的线栅偏振片提供的光传输效率更高。在LCD 3D打印的背景下，提高传输效率会提升紫外线强度、缩短打印时间、增加紫外线穿透深度以及拓宽固化表面。\n在投影微立体光刻（PμSL）中，空间调制器可将紫外光投射到构建板的整个区域，从而能够基于PμSL技术一次固化整个面层。空间调制器可以采用LCD、硅基液晶（LCoS）或数字微镜器件（DMD）的形式。虽然PμSL通常比基于点激光的SLA更快，但也具有其局限性。例如，从小型空间调制器芯片投射紫外光需要较高的放大因子，这会导致光强度随着表面积的增加而降低。\n此外，传统LCD具有两个正交薄膜偏振片，允许紫外线在某些区域通过。此时薄膜中电场的工作机理为吸收平行光，传输垂直光。这种传统方法虽然有效，但也降低了光引擎的有效强度。为了解决与薄膜偏光片相关的问题，可以改用金属线栅偏振片。金属线栅除了提升传输效率外，还可以提高其光承受强度。\n为了测试线栅偏振片的有效性，研究人员将它们与带有拉伸PVA偏振片的彩色和单色LCD进行了对比分析。每个设备都用于各种UV波长和光强度下的3D打印有机硅树脂部件。\n研究小组发现，PVA薄膜偏振片的透射效率在较短的波长下显著降低，而线栅偏振片在每个波长下透射的紫外光更多。薄膜和线栅性能之间的差异在波长低于400nm时最为明显。\n从研究结果中可以看出，对于365、385、405和450nm的波长，薄膜偏光片的透射效率分别为0.0%、1.1%、22.9%和34.8%。对于相同的波长，线栅偏振片的透射效率为34.4%、39.3%、39.1%和42.5%。\n最终结果表明，使用线栅偏光片具有更高的输出强度、损伤阈值、更好的树脂兼容性以及整体打印性能，由此证明它们在UV LCD 3D打印机中的可行性。该研究的更多细节可在发表于《增材制造》（Additive Manufacturing）期刊中的论文进行查阅。\n随着硬件的进步，SLA 3D打印已经取得长足进步。去年，总部位于奥地利的高精度光学设备开发商In-Vision推出了首款用于树脂3D打印机的4K紫外光投影仪。这款名为Phoenix的高性能光引擎凭借其高光强度和快速固化时间的设计特点而闻名。随着树脂3D打印技术不断的更新迭代，许多以前无法实现的应用现在都变成了可能。最近，3D打印机制造商B9Creations推出了一种新型树脂系列产品，可用于制造注塑模具。该系列产品包含ABS塑料和聚碳酸酯（PC）材料，具有高热变形温度，非常适合生产光滑、耐冲击的模具。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中国航发航材院", "源网址": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214860422000471", "源标题": "Research improves resin 3D printing using novel metal polarizer technology", "原文": "3D Printing Industry is currently seeking feedback on resin 3D printing. Send your insights now and take theSpotlight on Resin 3D Printing Survey.\nResearchers from theUniversity of Texas at AustinandLawrence Livermore National Laboratoryare investigating the use of metal wired grid polarizing filters in resin-based 3D printers.\nThe wired grid polarizers are designed to replace the conventional PVA film polarizers used in monochrome LCD screens, the component which generates the patterns for printing individual layers. Early testing has shown that the new wired grid polarizers offer a significantly higher light transmission efficiency when compared to their film counterparts.\nIn the context of LCD 3D printing, the increased transmission efficiency results in a higher intensity of UV light, shorter print times, a greater UV penetration depth (thicker layers), and a wider curing surface.\nPVA film polarizers versus wired grid polarizers\nIn projection micro stereolithography (PμSL), a spatial modulator is used to project UV light across the entire area of the build plate, allowing PμSL-based 3D printers to cure entire layers at once. The spatial modulator can take the form of an LCD, liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), or a digital micromirror device (DMD).\nWhile PμSL is generally faster than spot laser-based SLA, it does have its limitations. For instance, projecting UV light from a small-scale spatial modulator chip calls for a high magnification factor, which reduces the light intensity as the surface area increases.\nFurthermore, conventional LCDs feature two orthogonal film polarizers that allow UV light to pass through in certain areas. The mechanism at work here is absorption-based, whereby electrical fields in the films absorb light that is parallel to them but transmit light that is perpendicular. This conventional approach works but also reduces the effective intensity of the light engine.\nTo address the issues associated with film polarizers, it’s possible to use wired grid polarizers instead. Much like films, wired grid polarizers absorb parallel light but transmit perpendicular light, except they operate on a scatter mechanism rather than an absorption one. As well as resulting in higher transmission efficiency, metal wire grids can also withstand much higher light intensities without sustaining damage.\nTowards a higher transmission efficiency\nTo test the effectiveness of the wired grid polarizers, the US researchers compared them to both color and monochrome LCDs with stretched PVA polarizers. Each of the devices was used to 3D print silicone resin parts at a variety of UV wavelengths and light intensities.\nThe team found that the transmission efficiency of the PVA film polarizers decreased significantly at shorter wavelengths, while the wire grid polarizer transmitted more UV light at each wavelength. The difference between the film and wire grid performances was most pronounced at wavelengths of below 400nm.\nLooking at the figures, for wavelengths of 365, 385, 405, and 450nm, the film polarizers offered a transmission efficiency of 0.0%, 1.1%, 22.9%, and 34.8%. For the same wavelengths, the wire grid polarizers delivered 34.4%, 39.3%, 39.1%, and 42.5%.\nUltimately, the results showed that the use of wired grid polarizers lent itself to higher output intensity, a higher damage threshold, greater resin compatibility, and overall improved printing performance, demonstrating their feasibility in UV LCD 3D printers.\nFurther details of the study can be found in the paper titled ‘Use of wire grid polarizers with liquid crystal display for large-volume stereolithography’.\nSince its invention, SLA 3D printing has come a long way thanks to advancements in hardware. Just last year, In-Vision, an Austria-based developer of high-precision optical devices, launched its first 4K UV light projector for use with resin-based 3D printers. Named Phoenix, the high-performance light engine is designed specifically for applications that require high light intensities and rapid cure times.\nThere’s also something to be said about advancements in materials science, as new and improved 3D printing resins are constantly unlocking previously impossible applications. Recently, 3D printer manufacturer B9Creations launched a new line of resins that it says can be used to create injection molding-quality plastic molds.

While these devices' circuits have become increasingly pliable, the batteries and supercapacitors that power them are still rigid. Now, researchers in ACS' Nano Letters report a flexible supercapacitor with electrodes made of wrinkled titanium carbide—a type of MXene nanomaterial—that maintained its ability to store and release electronic charges after repetitive stretching.\nOne major challenge stretchable electronics must overcome is the stiff and inflexible nature of their energy storage components, batteries and supercapacitors. Supercapacitors that use electrodes made from transitional metal carbides, carbonitrides or nitrides, called MXenes, have desirable electrical properties for portable flexible devices, such as rapid charging and discharging. And the way that 2D MXenes can form multi-layered nanosheets provides a large surface area for energy storage when they're used in electrodes. However, previous researchers have had to incorporate polymers and other nanomaterials to keep these types of electrodes from breaking when bent, which decreases their electrical storage capacity. So, Desheng Kong and colleagues wanted to see if deforming a pristine titanium carbide MXene film into accordion-like ridges would maintain the electrode's electrical properties while adding flexibility and stretchability to a supercapacitor.\nThe researchers disintegrated titanium aluminum carbide powder into flakes with hydrofluoric acid and captured the layers of pure titanium carbide nanosheets as a roughly textured film on a filter. Then they placed the film on a piece of pre-stretched acrylic elastomer that was 800% its relaxed size. When the researchers released the polymer, it shrank to its original state, and the adhered nanosheets crumpled into accordion-like wrinkles.\nIn initial experiments, the team found the best electrode was made from a 3 ?m-thick film that could be repetitively stretched and relaxed without being damaged and without modifying its ability to store an electrical charge. The team used this material to fabricate a supercapacitor by sandwiching a polyvinyl(alcohol)-sulfuric acid gel electrolyte between a pair of the stretchable titanium carbide electrodes. The device had a high energy capacity comparable to MXene-based supercapacitors developed by other researchers, but it also had extreme stretchability up to 800% without the nanosheets cracking. It maintained approximately 90% of its energy storage capacity after being stretched 1,000 times, or after being bent or twisted.

Hydrogen and methanol engines are also being developed as part of this programme, as well as concepts for decentralised power-to-X plants. Power-to-x is a process that converts green electricity into storable fuel.\nRolls-Royce is also showcasing a model of its all-electric “Spirit of Innovation” aircraft in Glasgow. Rolls-Royce made history when it took to the skies for the first time in September 2021. Funded by the UK government, the “Accelerating the Electrification of Flight” project (ACCEL) is a highly specialised challenge to build the world’s fastest all-electric aircraft. This zero-emissions plane is expected to make a run for the record books with a target speed of 300+ MPH (480+ KMH). The advanced battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for electric vertical takeoff and landing [eVTOL] and commuter aircraft.\nFuel cell solutions, sustainable fuels, hydrogen and methanol engines and all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft are just some of the key elements in Rolls-Royce’s ambition to achieve net zero by 2050 at the latest. “We firmly believe that technology can be used to tackle the challenge of climate change. That is the reason why we are presenting our new technologies at the World Climate Summit. We are focusing our technological capabilities to play a leading role in enabling significant elements of the global economy to get to net zero carbon by 2050, including aviation, shipping, and power generation.” said Andreas Schell, CEO of Rolls-Royce Power Systems.\nRolls-Royce experts will be actively participating in various events at COP26. For example, Dr Daniel Chatterjee, Head of Technology Strategy at the Power Systems Business unit, will join the panel discussion on: “Green Business Globally: from circular business design to green technology solutions” on 6 November 2021 at 13:00 GMT in the EU Pavilion. Rachael Everard, Head of Sustainability at Rolls-Royce plc, Dave Smith, Director of Central Technology and Matheu Parr, Programme Lead for ACCEL are speaking on net zero aviation in the Climate Action Hub on Transport day at 16:00 GMT on 10 November which can be live streamed fromhere.\n", "中文原文": "·在第26届缔约方大会上的展览将展示解决气候变化的开拓性净零技术解决方案，包括mtu燃料电池和全电动飞机“创新精神”。·第二十六届缔约方会议是一次联合国关于气候变化以及各国计划如何应对气候变化的全球峰会，世界领导人、国家元首和皇室成员出席了会议。劳斯莱斯自豪地在2021年10月31日至11月12日于苏格兰格拉斯哥举行的联合国气候变化会议[COP26]上首次展示了其新的mtu燃料电池系统，用于未来无二氧化碳能源供应。兆瓦级范围供电的完整解决方案将从2025年开始串联生产。劳斯莱斯还在为船舶开发燃料电池系统，作为其净零功率系统气候保护计划的一部分，正在为使用可持续燃料准备其最重要的发动机系列。作为该项目的一部分，氢和甲醇发动机以及分散动力至X工厂的概念也在开发中。Power-to-x是一个将绿色电力转化为可储存燃料的过程。劳斯莱斯还在格拉斯哥展示了其全电动“创新精神”飞机模型。劳斯莱斯在2021年9月第一次登上天空时创造了历史。由英国政府资助的“加速飞行电气化”项目(ACCEL)是一项高度专业化的挑战，旨在制造世界上最快的全电动飞机。这架零排放飞机预计将以每小时300英里（480公里）的目标速度创造纪录。为该项目开发的先进电池和推进技术在电动垂直起降和通勤飞机上有着令人兴奋的应用。燃料电池解决方案、可持续燃料、氢和甲醇发动机以及全电动和混合动力飞机只是劳斯莱斯最迟在2050年实现净零排放的雄心中的一些关键要素。“我们坚信技术可以用来应对气候变化的挑战。这就是我们在世界气候峰会上展示我们新技术的原因。我们正在集中我们的技术能力，在使全球经济的重要组成部分到2050年实现净零碳方面发挥主导作用，包括航空、航运和发电。“劳斯莱斯电力系统公司首席执行官安德烈亚斯·谢尔说。劳斯莱斯专家将积极参与第二十六届缔约方大会的各种活动。例如，电力系统业务部门技术战略主管丹尼尔·查特吉博士将于2021年11月6日格林尼治时间13:00在欧盟馆参加关于“全球绿色商业：从循环商业设计到绿色技术解决方案”的小组讨论。劳斯莱斯（Rolls-Royce plc）可持续发展主管雷切尔·艾弗拉德（Rachael Everard)、中央技术总监戴夫·史密斯（Dave Smith）和阿塞尔（ACCEL）项目负责人马修·帕尔（Matheu Parr）将于11月10日格林尼治时间16:00在运输日的气候行动中心就净零航空发表讲话，这可以在这里直播。", "中文源标题": "劳斯莱斯在联合国气候变化大会上展示MTUFuel电池系统", "英文整编": "Rolls-Rolls first demonstrated its new MTU fuel cell system for future carbon dioxide-free energy supply at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow, Scotland from October 31 to November 12, 2021.The complete solution of this megawatt power supply will be approved from 2025.

They make up the shell of the fuel element. When the fuel is irradiated with a neutron flux, a fission chain reaction begins, accompanied by the release of thermal energy, which is then transferred to the coolant, explains Dmitry Sidelev at the Laboratory for Plasma Hybrid Systems of the Weinberg Research Centre, part of TPU’s School of Nuclear Science & Engineering.\n“If the operating mode of the reactor is violated and emergency situations occur, the risk a self-sustaining steam-zirconium reaction leading to intensive oxidation of fuel assemblies, heat release and hydrogen generation increases. As a result, the integrity of the fuel assembly may be violated.\"\nThe TPU team is working to prevent the destruction of fuel element cladding and spacer grids made of zirconium alloy. Chrome coatings are a thin film 10 micrometres thick. As a material for creating protective coatings, chromium was chosen because it is a heat-resistant metal that is also resistant to oxidation and corrosion.\nStudies were carried out first on test samples, then on industrial samples of welded joints produced for the Tomsk scientists by the Novosibirsk plant of chemical concentrates plant (part of Rosatom’s fuel company TVEL). The coatings were applied using a vacuum ion-plasma installation developed by the staff at the Weinberg laboratory.\n“A lot of work has been done to optimise the structure and composition of chrome coatings. Empirically, we have revealed an acceptable mode for depositing coatings in order to achieve their maximum dense structure. This is necessary so that oxygen does not penetrate the alloy and initiate the oxidation process. We also found out how the thickness of the coatings affects the oxidation process. As a result, the required range of coatings thicknesses (10-15 micrometres) was established,\" Yegor Kashkarov, head of the Advanced Materials Laboratory. The use of protective chromium coatings increases the time for reactor operators to make decisions in emergency situations.\nAt the moment, TPU scientists are studying the possibilities of optimising the elemental composition and structure of protective coatings to improve their protective properties.

While previous tests of this nature have used one-off prototypes or technology demonstrators, the latest announcement marks what the pair call “the world's first demonstration of an industrialized optical communications terminal for airborne applications.”\nInitial flights of the campaign utilized a setup of two of Mynaric's Hawk products for airborne laser communication on the ground and mounted in the fuselage payload bay of a G520NG aircraft, respectively, to demonstrate air-to-ground links.\nThe setup was recently cleared for flight by all relevant regulatory aviation authorities. The first flights of the campaign demonstrated stable bidirectional laser links with 10 Gbps speed between the aircraft and the terminal on the ground during various flight patterns.\nDifficult challenge\n“Closing laser communication links in the air is in many dimensions a lot harder than in space given the aircrafts' movements and atmospheric conditions,”said Bulent Altan, CEO of Mynaric.\n“Having overcome these challenges, Hawk offers connectivity with unprecedented security and bandwidth to airborne platforms. As the world's first industrialized optical communications terminal for airborne applications, it enables aeronautical communication capabilities previously unimaginable.”\n“Our customers today are stuck with sub-par data rates in the low Mbps range for air-to-ground use cases and are limited to no real available solutions for air-to-air connectivity,” said Tina Ghataore, Chief Commercial Officer of Mynaric.\n‘Sweet spot’\n“The Hawk range hits the sweet spot for transfering large quantities of data at gigabit rates quickly and securely. From remotely piloted aircraft systems, to transport and commercial aircraft, we see our products becoming integral to future airborne and mobility networks.”\nThe flight campaign utilizes a G520NG aircraft suited for manned or unmanned missions at high altitudes of up to 15,200m (50,000 ft) and for long endurances.

During PC 21, soldiers experimented with ways to use UAS to do autonomous target sensing, helping soldiers see on the battlefield. (Spc. Kayla Anstey/U.S. Army)\nWASHINGTON — Those with boots on the ground are looking to the skies for the extended, accelerated and protected communication and data-sharing capabilities needed to meet the challenge of high-tech opponents on battlefields the world over.\nThe U.S. Army is experimenting with what it calls the aerial tier network, airborne assets that can relay information, reduce reaction times and help resolve communication breakdowns in areas where foliage, mountains and buildings impede signals.\nSpecifically, the Army is tackling two conundrums with its experimentation: first, how to extend lines of communication on the ground, perhaps by using unmanned systems such as small drones; and second, how to quicken the pace of air-to-air and air-to-ground information exchange to address threats more efficiently.\n“When we talk about aerial tier, that means a lot of things to a lot of people,” Col. Greg Napoli, the unified network lead for the Network Cross-Functional Team, part of Army Futures Command, said at an industry meeting in Philadelphia last month. “It can mean aerostats to some people. It can mean fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft comms relays or” intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, “or even weapons delivery platforms to other people.”\nThe improvements will be critical, Army leaders and technical experts agree, as the service transitions into multi-domain operations, or MDO, the ability to fight and win against a technologically advanced enemy on land, in the air and sea, and across cyber and space. The same thinking also considers how an adversary — such as Russia in a battle for Europe, or China in a battle for the Pacific — would contest, intercept or otherwise mess with American chatter.\n“As part of this, we’re going to look at the ability, under these learning objectives, to communicate under jamming conditions,” said Scott Newman, a project manager at the Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, or PEO C3T, an Army network modernization outfit. “We’re going to be looking at detectability, we’re going to be looking at directionality with this.”\nUpgrading and hardening Army networks is one of several heavy lifts the service is conducting as it wrangles the challenges of larger, dispersed fighting. Other priorities include air-and-missile defense, future vertical lift and long-range precision fires.\nBoth the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team and the Program Executive Office for Aviation are assisting with the aerial tier endeavor.\nTo create the network of the future, the Army, via PEO C3T and its sister organizations, is using what are known as capability sets: streams of research, feedback and in-the-field testing that introduce new and needed tech to the battlefield every two years.\nThe effort kicked off in fiscal 2021, with results expected in 2023, 2025, 2027 and beyond. The aerial tier is an important element of Capability Set ‘25, maturing now, and Capability Set ‘27, further down the line and still coalescing.\n“In Capability Set ‘21, we have a capability called the variable height antenna,” which can rise above the canopy and boost the range of the Army’s network, Napoli said. “What we would like to look at doing for Capability Set ‘25 is expanding that capability to a drone that can loiter at the time and place of that S6, where that S6 and where that commander needs it to, in order to extend that tactical mesh network, what we’re calling the ITN mesh network.”\nGetting things right has been difficult. Napoli described a “continuing challenge” for the Army, as it attempts to clear technical- and physics-related hurdles.\nKinks can be worked out at events including the annual Network Modernization Experiment, or NetModX, hosted by the C5ISR Center, and the grander Project Convergence, the Army’s contribution to the Pentagon’s vision of seamless communication known as Joint All-Domain Command and Control.\nBoth replicate real-world conditions to generate data that will shape consequential decisions. Napoli said input from the military and its labs and from industry is critical “as we move forward.”\nThere were some 1,500 participants at Project Convergence 21, and more than 100 pieces of advanced gear entered the crucible. The Army, specifically, put into play aerial prototypes and surrogates to enable communication across ground and air nodes. Aerial tier communications on an unmanned system “performed well in a dedicated communications relay role,” the Army said in a late-April update.\nThe 2021 experimentation underlined the value of an aerial tier for Brig. Gen. Jeth Rey, the director of the Network Cross-Functional Team.\n“We did not realize how important it was to have an aerial tier overhead loitering for more than 20 to 26 hours and providing an extension of our network,” Rey said in December, recalling his lessons learned. C4ISRNET previously reported Rey was interesting in pursuing and improving the capability.\n", "中文原文": "2021年10月20日，亚利桑那州尤马试验场，一个无人驾驶航空系统在融合项目上飞行。在PC 21期间，士兵们试验了使用UAS进行自主目标感知的方法，帮助士兵在战场上看到。（Spc.凯拉·安斯蒂/美国陆军）华盛顿--那些在地面上穿着靴子的人正在仰望天空，寻找应对世界战场上高科技对手挑战所需的扩展、加速和受保护的通信和数据共享能力。美国陆军正在试验它所说的空中层级网络，这是一种空中资产，可以传递信息，减少反应时间，并帮助解决树叶、山脉和建筑阻碍信号的地区的通信故障。具体来说，陆军的实验正在解决两个难题：第一，如何扩大地面通信线路，可能是通过使用小型无人机等无人系统；第二，如何加快空对空和空对地信息交流的速度，以更有效地应对威胁。“当我们谈论空中层时，这对许多人来说意味着很多事情，”格雷格·那不勒斯上校上个月在费城的一次行业会议上说，格雷格·那不勒斯上校是陆军期货司令部网络跨职能小组的统一网络负责人，他是陆军期货司令部的一部分。“对一些人来说，这可能意味着浮空器。它可能意味着固定翼或旋转翼飞机与其他人通信或“情报、监视和侦察”，甚至武器投递平台。“陆军领导人和技术专家一致认为，随着军种过渡到多域作战，即在陆地、空中和海上以及网络和空间与技术先进的敌人作战并获胜的能力，这些改进将是至关重要的。同样的想法也考虑到一个对手--比如欧洲战争中的俄罗斯，或者太平洋战争中的中国--将如何对抗、拦截或以其他方式扰乱美国的喋喋不休。“作为其中的一部分，我们将根据这些学习目标，研究在干扰条件下通信的能力，”斯科特·纽曼说，他是陆军网络现代化机构指挥、控制和通信-战术项目执行办公室或PEO C3T的项目经理。“我们将着眼于可探测性，我们将着眼于方向性。”升级和强化陆军网络是该部门在应对更大规模、分散战斗的挑战时正在进行的几项重大举措之一。其他优先事项包括空中和导弹防御、未来的垂直升降和远程精确火力。未来垂直升降机跨职能小组和航空项目执行办公室都在协助航空层的努力。为了创建未来的网络，陆军通过PEO C3T及其姐妹组织，正在使用所谓的能力集：研究、反馈和实地测试流，每两年向战场引入新的和需要的技术。这项努力始于2021财年，预计将在2023、2025、2027年及以后取得成果。空中层是能力集25的重要元素，现在已经成熟，而能力集27则在更远的线下，仍然在合并。那不勒斯说：“在能力集'21中，我们有一种叫做可变高度天线的能力，”它可以升到树冠上方，扩大陆军网络的范围。“我们希望为能力集'25'做的是将这种能力扩展到一种无人机，这种无人机可以在S6的时间和地点、S6的地方和指挥官需要它的地方游荡，以扩展战术网状网络，我们称之为ITN网状网络。”把事情做好很难。那不勒斯描述了军队面临的“持续挑战”，因为它试图清除技术和物理相关的障碍。Kinks可以在活动中解决，包括由C5ISR中心主办的年度网络现代化实验，或NetModX，以及更大的融合项目，陆军对五角大楼无缝通信愿景的贡献，即联合全域指挥和控制。两者都复制现实世界的条件，以生成将影响后续决策的数据。那不勒斯说，“随着我们的前进”，军方及其实验室和工业界的投入至关重要。约有1500人参加了汇合21项目，超过100件先进的设备进入坩埚。具体来说，陆军投入了空中原型和代理，以实现地面和空中节点之间的通信。陆军在4月下旬的更新中表示，无人系统上的空中层通信“在专用通信中继角色中表现出色”。2021年的实验强调了航空层对网络跨职能小组主任杰斯·雷伊准将的价值。“我们没有意识到头顶上有一个空中层有多重要", "中文源标题": "美陆军向天空伸手解决通信需求", "英文整编": "The U.S. Army is conducting an air layer network test, aiming to find a way to transmit information, shorten response time and solveAir communication equipment for solving communication problems in areas with blocked signals such as jungles, mountains and buildings.

It is the first step in developing an operational autonomous submarine that will work side-by-side with crewed submarines – including the Astute-class hunter-killers and their successors – or independently.\nIts maximum operational depth will exceed that of the current submarine fleet, meaning Cetus will equip the Royal Navy with even greater reach into the oceans in support of UK defence. It will be able to cover up to 1,000 miles in a single mission.\nCetus will be 12 metres long – the length of a double decker bus – 2.2 metres in diameter and weigh 17 tonnes. It will be the largest and most complex crewless submersible operated by a European navy. The bespoke vessel is being designed and built for the Royal Navy by Plymouth-based tech firm MSubs. This contract will create 10 and support 70 specialist jobs in the city.\nIn order to meet the growing threats to our underwater infrastructure, the Royal Navy needs to be ahead of the competition with cutting edge capabilities. Project Cetus, alongside bringing forward the MROS ships, will help ensure we have the right equipment to protect the security of the UK and our Allies.\nHaving the skills base and specialist knowledge to develop and build this vessel in the UK, is testament to the UKs leading reputation in building surface and sub-surface ships.\nThe vessel’s size means that it will fit inside a shipping container and can therefore be transported around the world to wherever it is needed. It will be designed to operate with all of the ships from the Royal Navy fleet as well as those of our allies.\nCetus will be a platform for the Royal Navy on which to experiment and build cutting edge technologies and capabilities around, encouraging innovation and developing best practice. The unarmed vessel is battery powered, meaning its effective range can be increased by installing additional batteries.\nIt has also been designed to be modular, with an optional section that can be added to double the capacity of the vessel.\nThe crewless submarine is the latest step taken by the Royal Navy into autonomous systems, and have been for over a decade. Crewless minehunting systems are already operating in Scotland, and driverlessPacific 24 sea boatsare undergoing testing. Various aerial drones are used by ships for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.\nThe Navy has invested in a dedicated tech trials ship,XV Patrick Blackett, to assess and test new equipment and determine how it could be used or integrated into the fleet. Cetus is the equivalent for sub-sea experimentation.\nThis is a hugely exciting moment for Project Cetus as the Royal Navy surges ahead with the development of autonomous technology.

(NASA PR) — NASA has selected nine space technologies under the agency’s 2021 TechFlights solicitation for testing aboard parabolic aircraft, high-altitude balloons, and suborbital rocket-powered systems.\nThis $5.5 million investment in technology demonstration activities will support the advancement of a wide range of technologies that address mission needs for both NASA and the commercial space industry. By exposing these innovations to many of the rigors and characteristics of spaceflight – without the expense of an orbital flight – NASA can more rapidly help ensure these technologies work correctly when they are deployed on future missions. The technologies were selected under theFlight Opportunitiesprogram within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), which develops transformative space technologies to enable future missions.\n“By supporting suborbital flight testing, our Flight Opportunitiesprogram aims to help ensure that these innovations are well-positioned to address NASA’s space exploration and scientific discovery goals, while also supporting commercial space infrastructure,” said Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs in STMD at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nAs part of the latest cohort ofTechFlightsselections, the organizations developing the selected technologies will receive a grant or collaborative agreement allowing them to purchase flights from a U.S. commercial flight vendor that best meets their needs – a process that can help decrease the time needed for bringing innovations from lab-based testing to flight test. This year’s solicitation again included an option for researchers to propose accompanying their payloads on suborbital space flights enabling them to tend to experiments in real time rather than relying on an automated experiment setup. As with all selections, researchers with human-tended payloads will need to ensure that they meet NASA’s requirements laid out in the solicitation prior to funds being awarded.\n“Each year, the group of technologies proposed for the TechFlights solicitations is more impressive, and this year’s selections address some of NASA’s critical technology gaps. In addition, we are pleased to see new researchers and organizations participating in TechFlights,” said John Kelly, program manager for Flight Opportunities at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. \nThe capsule of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket-based system descends to Earth assisted by parachute following a launch in December 2019.

And one provision calls for keeping the technology from having any involvement in nuclear weapons employment.\nThe “Political Declaration on the Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy,” released by the department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance, notes that an increasing number of countries are developing military AI capabilities and could use the tech to enable autonomous systems.\n“A principled approach to the military use of AI should include careful consideration of risks and benefits, and it should also minimize unintended bias and accidents,” the document states, calling on governments to “take appropriate measures to ensure the responsible development, deployment, and use of their military AI capabilities, including those enabling autonomous systems.”\nThe term artificial intelligence, according to the drafters of the declaration, refers to “the ability of machines to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — for example, recognizing patterns, learning from experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions, or taking action — whether digitally or as the smart software behind autonomous physical systems.”\nAdvertisement\nIn this context, they define autonomy as “a system operating without further human intervention after activation.”\nAlthough not explicitly stated, the declaration implies that giving AI a significant role in strategic weapon systems would be too risky.\nAmong the list of about a dozen “best practices” promoted in the document is that governments “should maintain human control and involvement for all actions critical to informing and executing sovereign decisions concerning nuclear weapons employment.”\nThe declaration comes on the heels of the Pentagon’s recent update of DOD Directive 3000.09, “Autonomy in Weapon Systems,” which was signed off by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and went into effect last month.\nUnlike the State Department declaration, the Pentagon directive did not explicitly mention nuclear weapons.\nAdvertisement\nConcerns about the potential consequences of handing nuclear command-and-control capabilities over to machines aren’t new. That was a central theme of Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 film “Dr. Strangelove,” in which a Soviet “Doomsday device” automatically unleashes Armageddon in response to a crisis scenario.\nHowever, as artificial intelligence technology improves and defense officials around the world move to incorporate it into their forces for a wide range of potential mission sets, issues surrounding the tech have become more prominent.\nIn a report released just last week, the Arms Control Association warned about the perils of increased automation of battlefield decision-making, including as it relates command, control and communications (C3).\n“Many of these technologies are still in their infancy and prone to often unanticipated malfunctions,” author Michael Klare wrote.\n“Given these risks, Chinese, Russian, and U.S. policymakers should be leery of accelerating the automation of their C3 systems. Ideally, government officials and technical experts of the three countries should meet … to consider limitations on the use of any automated decision-making devices with ties to nuclear command systems,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nThe Pentagon, which a few years ago rolled out a set of AI ethical principles, has not been pushing to give autonomy to nuclear weapon systems, although it sees a major role for the cutting-edge tech in its conventional forces.\nAI and autonomy expert Paul Scharre, vice president and director of studies at the Center for a New American Security think tank, has told this reporter that giving autonomy to nuclear command-and-control systems would be “crazy.”\nLauren Kahn, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who focuses on emerging tech, praised the release of the declaration in a series of tweets Thursday.\n“While non-binding, it will serve as a building block to ensure that there is international coordination on starting to lay down the rules of the road when it comes to AI on the battlefield,” she wrote. “Overall, the statement promotes several important principles that build off DoD AI/autonomy policy, such as ensuring … that there will ALWAYS be positive human control over any nuclear weapons.”\nThe State Department is hoping to get other countries on the same page when it comes to guiding principles surrounding military applications of AI and autonomy, as it seeks their endorsement of the declaration that was rolled out on Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the document was released, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Bonnie Jenkins tweeted that the Biden administration is “committed to promoting rules of the road that enhance transparency, predictability, & stability in military use of #AI and we welcome engagement with any country that is interested in joining us in building an international consensus.”\nWhile many nations are pursuing AI that could have military applications, there are currently nine nations that possess or are presumed to possess nukes, including the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.\nKahn tweeted that it “will be interesting to track which states will also voluntarily opt-in and co-sign the statement in the coming months. Will be important for it to not just be US+NATO+Five Eyes but a broader coalition of states, especially those working on the cutting edge of AI development.”\n", "中文原文": "美国国务院周四公布了一份关于人工智能和自主武器的新声明，希望其他国家也能签署。由乔恩·哈珀2023年2月16日（盖蒂图像公司）美国国务院周四公布了一份关于人工智能和自主武器的新声明，希望其他国家也能签署。其中一项条款要求禁止这项技术参与核武器的使用。国防部军备控制、核查和合规局发布的《关于负责任地在军事上使用人工智能和自主的政治宣言》指出，越来越多的国家正在发展军事人工智能能力，并可以使用这项技术来实现自主系统。“对人工智能军事使用的原则性方法应该包括仔细考虑风险和好处，还应该尽量减少无意的偏见和事故，”该文件指出，并呼吁各国政府“采取适当措施，确保负责任地开发、部署和使用其军事人工智能能力，包括那些启用自治系统的能力。”根据《宣言》起草者的说法，人工智能一词是指“机器执行原本需要人类智能的任务的能力--例如，识别模式、从经验中学习、得出结论、做出预测或采取行动--无论是数字方式还是作为自主物理系统背后的智能软件。”广告宣传在这种情况下，他们将自治定义为“激活后无需进一步人为干预而运行的系统”。尽管没有明确声明，但该声明暗示，让人工智能在战略武器系统中发挥重要作用风险太大。该文件中提倡的大约十几种“最佳做法”包括，政府“应该对所有对通报和执行有关核武器使用的主权决定至关重要的行动保持人为控制和参与。”此前，五角大楼最近更新了国防部第3000.09号指令“武器系统的自主性”，该指令由国防部副部长凯瑟琳·希克斯签署，并于上月生效。与国务院的声明不同，五角大楼的指令没有明确提到核武器。广告宣传对将核指挥与控制能力移交给机器的潜在后果的担忧并不新鲜。这是斯坦利·库布里克1964年的电影《博士》的中心主题。《异乡人》中，一个苏联“末日装置”自动释放世界末日，以应对危机场景。然而，随着人工智能技术的进步，以及世界各地的国防官员将其纳入他们的部队，用于广泛的潜在任务集，围绕这项技术的问题变得更加突出。在上周发布的一份报告中，军备控制协会警告了战场决策自动化程度提高的风险，包括与指挥、控制和通信(C3)相关的风险。作者迈克尔·克莱尔写道：“这些技术中的许多仍处于起步阶段，往往容易出现意想不到的故障。”“鉴于这些风险，中国、俄罗斯和美国的政策制定者应该对加速C3系统的自动化持谨慎态度。理想情况下，这三个国家的政府官员和技术专家应该会面……考虑限制使用与核指挥系统有关的任何自动决策设备，“他说。广告宣传五角大楼几年前推出了一套人工智能道德原则，但一直没有推动赋予核武器系统自主权，尽管它认为尖端技术在其常规部队中发挥着重要作用。人工智能和自主性专家保罗·沙雷（Paul Scharre）是一个新的美国安全智库中心的副总裁兼研究主任，他告诉本报记者，赋予核指挥与控制系统自主性是“疯狂的”。外交关系委员会（Council on Foreign Relations）专注于新兴技术的研究员劳伦·卡恩（Lauren Kahn）周四在一系列推特上赞扬了该宣言的发布。她写道：“虽然不具约束力，但它将作为一个基石，确保在战场上开始制定人工智能规则时进行国际协调。”“总的来说，该声明促进了国防部人工智能/自治政策的几项重要原则，如确保……人类永远对任何核武器进行积极的控制。”美国国务院希望在围绕人工智能和自治的军事应用的指导原则方面，让其他国家达成一致，寻求它们对周四推出的声明的支持。广告宣传文件发布后，Undersecr", "中文源标题": "美国试图让其他国家同意避开人工智能用于核指挥和控制", "英文整编": "On February 16, the Arms Control, Verification and Compliance Bureau of the US State Department issued the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems, which requires preventing artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons technology from having anything to do with the use of nuclear weapons, and hopes that other countries can also sign it. The declaration pointed out that more and more countries are developing military artificial intelligence and may use this technology to realize autonomous systems. The document calls on governments to take appropriate measures to ensure the responsible development, deployment and use of their military artificial intelligence. According to the drafters of the manifesto, the term \"artificial intelligence\" refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that originally require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, learning from experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions or taking actions. Among them, \"autonomous\" is defined as a system that can run without further human intervention after activation. The declaration was issued after the US Department of Defense recently updated \"Defense Directive 30000.09\" and \"Weapon System Autonomy\", which was signed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Catherine Hicks and came into effect in January.

Jon Hill, MDA director, told Defense News Aug. 12 at the SMD Symposium here, “and so we’re taking that on.”\nJust a year ago, MDA had a different answer on where it was going with hypersonic defense, focusing on solutions under development in the science and technology phase, Hill said.\nBut after taking a step back and assessing the U.S. ballistic missile defense capability, the agency realized it already had some means to t ackle hypersonic weapons using such sea- based assets as a Navy Carrier Strike Group with the ability to engage high-speed maneuvering threats during the terminal phase of flight.\nThe Sea-Based X-Band Terminal is another example of a current capability that can track hypersonic threats in the terminal phase, he noted.\nThe Aegis ship, which boasts launch-on-remote weaponry, is capable of seeing hypersonic weapons in the battlespace because, “remember, they’re not very high,” Hill said. “They are around 70 kilometers.”\nFuture efforts already scheduled to come online are systems like the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), a satellite that will be placed in low-earth orbit to spot hypersonic missiles in flight, and the SPY-6 radar will further increase the ability to track hypersonic threats, Hill added.\nThe agency decided it would make the most sense to focus on taking out hypersonic weapons in the glide phase of flight where they are most vulnerable, Hill said.\nMDA then assessed current and possible capability and concepts to be able to detect, track and intercept a hypersonic weapon in that glide phase.\nThe agency studied data from adversaries’ systems. “Our adversaries are constantly flying these things and we are collecting that data with the existing sensor architecture,” Hill said. “We were pulling that data down and we could run it through our high fidelity systems models.”\nTaking that data, MDA asked, “What sort of material do we need on the seekers? What sort of divert capability do we need? Do we use a fragmentation warhead or do we want to do hit-to-kill in the glide phase because it’s a different battle? It’s a different environment,” Hill said.\nMDA has discovered it can use the existing booster stacks and can focus on developing a front-end for an interceptor, Hill said.\nWhat’s missing now is the weapon, he noted. The systems that exist now, like the SM-3 interceptor, which is designed to operate in space, and the SM-6, that is designed to operate in the atmosphere, “doesn’t get you there.”\nArmed with the new strategy, the agency came out with a solicitation to industry asking for white papers on solutions for its Glide Phase Interceptor, or GPI, in April.\nWhile the MDA is still doing risk reduction for more exquisite capabilities to be brought online later, Hill said, “from a regional perspective, we can go after this now.”\nThe agency will first focus on providing a capability to the Navy, and “if this is successful,” Hill said, “we can move it to the land-based battery to protect other things against that sort of hypersonic threat.”\nHill could not elaborate on a timeline for fielding a glide phase interceptor, but said he expected to conduct a systems requirements review later this year and would choose industry teams to work on development.\nAnd then there’s the matter of securing future funding, which is yet to be determined but will also influence the effort’s timeline, according to Hill.\nDuring a presentation at the SMD Symposium, Hill played a short video that described how a GPI would work as part of a multi-layered hypersonic defensive capability.\nIn the scenario, an enemy launched four hypersonic vehicles in succession. The HBTSS detects the launch and the first, second and third stages of separation from the booster and then relays that information to the Ballistic Missile Defense System Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture, or BOA.\nBOA uses real-time data from HBTSS to create a track of the hypersonic glide vehicle. Then an Aegis ship receives fire control quality data from BOA and the Command Control Battle Management Communications system, or C2BMC, through satellite communication.\nAegis then uses its remote tracking and engage-on-remote capability to launch the GPI, capable of flying faster and with more agility than the threat, taking out the hypersonic glide vehicle, the idea goes.\n", "中文原文": "阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔。-虽然导弹防御局在推出防御性高超音速武器的努力上按下了暂停键，但它现在已经准备好向前迈进，并正在让工业界参与第一阶段的努力。“我们从工业界得到了一些很好的反馈，这是可以做的事情，我们不应该害怕去做，”MDA主任副上将乔恩·希尔在8月12日的SMD研讨会上告诉国防新闻，“所以我们正在接受这一点。”希尔说，就在一年前，MDA对高超音速防御有了不同的答案，专注于科技阶段正在开发的解决方案。但在后退一步评估美国弹道导弹防御能力后，该机构意识到，它已经有了一些手段来使用海基资产来打击高超音速武器，如海军航母打击群，该群有能力在飞行的最后阶段应对高速机动威胁。他指出，海基X波段终端是当前能够在终端阶段跟踪高超音速威胁的能力的另一个例子。希尔说，拥有远程发射武器的宙斯盾舰能够在战场上看到高超音速武器，因为“记住，它们不是很高”。“它们在70公里左右。”希尔补充说，未来已经计划上线的工作是像高超音速和弹道跟踪空间传感器(HBTSS)这样的系统，这是一颗将被放置在近地轨道上以发现飞行中的高超音速导弹的卫星，SPY-6雷达将进一步提高跟踪高超音速威胁的能力。希尔说，该机构决定，最有意义的是专注于在飞行中最脆弱的滑翔阶段取出高超音速武器。MDA随后评估了当前和可能的能力和概念，以能够在滑翔阶段探测、跟踪和拦截高超音速武器。该机构研究了对手系统的数据。希尔说：“我们的对手不断地飞行这些东西，我们正在用现有的传感器架构收集这些数据。”“我们把这些数据拉下来，然后通过我们的高保真系统模型运行它。”拿着这些数据，MDA问道：“我们需要什么样的关于搜索者的材料？我们需要什么样的转移能力？我们是使用破片弹头还是想在滑翔阶段进行命中到杀伤，因为这是一场不同的战斗？这是一个不同的环境，“希尔说。希尔说，MDA发现它可以使用现有的助推器栈，并可以专注于开发拦截器的前端。他指出，现在缺少的是武器。现在存在的系统，如设计用于太空的SM-3拦截器和设计用于大气层的SM-6拦截器，“不能让你到达那里”。在新战略的武装下，该机构在4月份向行业发出征集，要求提供关于其滑翔阶段拦截器(GPI)解决方案的白皮书。虽然MDA仍在降低风险，以便稍后将更多精致的功能上线，希尔说，“从地区的角度来看，我们现在可以追求这一点。”希尔说，该机构将首先专注于向海军提供一种能力，“如果这是成功的”，“我们可以将其转移到陆基电池，以保护其他东西免受这种高超音速威胁。”希尔无法详细说明部署滑翔阶段拦截器的时间表，但他表示，他预计将在今年晚些时候进行系统需求审查，并将选择行业团队进行开发。希尔说，还有一个问题是确保未来的资金，这还有待确定，但也将影响这项努力的时间表。在SMD研讨会上的一次演讲中，希尔播放了一个简短的视频，描述了GPI作为多层高超音速防御能力的一部分是如何工作的。在场景中，一个敌人连续发射了四个高超音速飞行器。HBTSS检测发射以及与助推器分离的第一、第二和第三阶段，然后将这些信息传递给弹道导弹防御系统头顶持久红外结构，或BOA。BOA使用HBTSS的实时数据来创建高超音速滑翔飞行器的轨迹。然后，宙斯盾舰通过卫星通信从BOA和指挥控制战斗管理通信系统(C2BMC)接收火控质量数据。宙斯盾随后利用其远程跟踪和远程接合能力发射GPI，该GPI能够比威胁更快、更敏捷地飞行，摧毁高超音速滑翔飞行器。", "中文源标题": "导弹防御局加快速度寻求高超音速拦截器", "英文整编": "Although the US Missile Defense Agency suspended the research and development of defensive hypersonic weapons some time ago, it is now ready to restart and is implementing the first phase of related work.Lt.

This joint effort, however, is beingdeveloped separately by the individual services, each coming up with its own concept of how JADC2 could work. What JADC2 will become in practice isstill somewhat amorphous.\nIn the paper, the Mitchell Institute’s Senior Fellow for Spacepower Studies Tim Ryan suggests these efforts be consolidated under the Chief of Space Operations, with the power to define key authorities and standards of JADC2 efforts. In Ryan’s view, the CSO should be given “the primary responsibility of overseeing the integration of the entire JADC2 system.” Without better coordination among the services’ efforts, JADC2 programs risk being neither joint nor all-domain.\nBecause the Space Force’s satellites will be part of the “transport layer” of JADC2 that the U.S. military says will underpin its future operations, the service needs more precise strategic guidance about its mission, more responsibility, better training, and increased funding, according to Ryan. The goal would be to empower the Space Force to help make JADC2 a reality and to fulfill its vital role as a facilitator of U.S. operations by giving it the means to protect its assets.\n“This sounds very expensive,” Ryan said during a roundtable with reporters to preview the paper. “It sounds very complex. I understand that. And I agree that it is.”\nAmerica’s adversaries, primarily China, have their own military space components. The People’s Liberation Army’s Strategic Support Forcewants to be able to disrupt an enemy’s command and control networks in space.\n“It is much, much cheaper to do it right the first time because, quite frankly, I don’t think we’re going to get a second chance on this,” said Ryan. “The second chance is we lose.”\nU.S. military leaders, inside and outside of the Space Force, have begun voicing concern that America’s space assets, which include capabilities as fundamental as GPS,could be disrupted by an attack. The Biden administration is pursuing improved global norms in space, such asa ban on testing most anti-satellite weaponsand stricter rules requiring operators todeorbit their defunct satellites. States such as China, however,often ignore international agreements, even if they are enacted, especially the current non-binding efforts the U.S. is pursuing.\nRyan’s paper argues that the DOD must articulate the need for, and Congress must approve, funding for the defense of space assets critical to JADC2. American military and civilian officials publicly acknowledge thatspace will become contested in future conflicts. Senior Space Force leaders have begun to float concept of “space superiority.”\n“What that really means is the ability to take a punch and to continue to fight,” said Lt. Gen. Nina M. Armagno, the director of staff of the Space Force,at AFA’s Air, Space, & Cyber Conference in September.\nMissing from that statement is an explicit ability for America to fight back directly when it is attacked in space, as it does in other domains.\nRyan, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who served in a variety of space roles and also worked as a civilian on the Space Force staff at the Pentagon, recommends in his paper that the Space Force receive authorization and funding to “develop space-based weapons systems that are specifically designed to defend the JADC2 space transport layer against kinetic and non-kinetic acts of aggression.”\nWhile theBiden administration’s efforts to improve the safety of space operationsthrough international norms are laudable, the U.S. still needs a clear space deterrent as America’s adversaries may be willing to ignore international norms, according to Mitchell Institute experts.\n“Where’s the hard power in the current construct? It really doesn’t exist,” said Douglas A. Birkey, the executive director of the think tank. “Otherwise, we’re actually risking an increased likelihood of conflict in space because there are no real consequences they’re going to care about.”\nEstablished in 2019, the Space Force is mainly made up of systems and personnel from other services. The President’s budget request for fiscal 2023, which Congress has not yet passed,allocates $24.5 billion for the Space Force, a $7 billion increase over 2022. These budget increases, however, do not necessarily reflect new capabilities, as other services have shifted the burden and the cost of space assets to the Space Force.\nAccording to Ryan, a larger budget is required. However, he acknowledged that putting that into legislationwould be challenging.\n“Any current increase in the current Space Force budget [has] been primarily done through stand-up actions and being able to integrate the other services’ capabilities into the Space Force,” Ryan said. “At the end of the day, quite frankly, the money has not been equal to the demands that are being placed on the Space Force and the increased demands that it will have with JADC2.”\nIn the view of Birkey, space cannot be seen as devoid of consequences on Earth if U.S. space assets are attacked and systems go down.\n“We have got to get real because everything else is going to fall offline fast and lives will be on the line,” he said.\n", "中文原文": "2022年10月21日，克里斯·戈登根据AFA米切尔航空航天研究所的一份新政策文件，太空部队必须对美国军方联合全域指挥和控制(JADC2)工作的不同部分拥有领导权。JADC2是国防部通过收集更多数据并在各军种之间分享这些信息以改善指挥和控制的一项努力，一直到战术级别。然而，这种共同努力是由各个服务单独开发的，每个服务都对JADC2如何工作提出了自己的概念。JADC2在实践中会变成多少还是无定形的。在这篇论文中，米切尔研究所的太空动力研究高级研究员蒂姆·瑞安建议，这些努力应该由太空作战部长统一起来，有权定义JADC2努力的关键权力和标准。在Ryan看来，CSO应该被赋予“监督整个JADC2系统集成的主要责任”如果没有更好地协调服务之间的努力，JADC2项目可能既不是联合的，也不是全领域的。瑞安说，因为太空部队的卫星将是美国军方表示将支持其未来行动的JADC2“运输层”的一部分，所以该服务需要对其任务进行更精确的战略指导、更多的责任、更好的培训和更多的资金。目标是授权太空部队帮助实现JADC2，并通过赋予其保护其资产的手段来履行其作为美国行动促进者的重要角色。“这听起来非常昂贵，”瑞安在与记者的圆桌会议上说，以预览该文件。“听起来很复杂。我明白。我同意这一点。“美国的对手，主要是中国，都有自己的太空军事组成部分。中国人民解放军的战略支援部队希望能够破坏敌人在太空的指挥和控制网络。瑞安说：“第一次做对要便宜得多，因为坦率地说，我不认为我们会有第二次机会。”“第二次机会是我们失去了。”美国太空部队内外的军事领导人已经开始表示担心，美国的太空资产，包括全球定位系统等基本能力，可能会因袭击而中断。拜登政府正在寻求改善太空领域的全球规范，例如禁止测试大多数反卫星武器，以及要求运营商离轨其失效卫星的更严格规则。然而，中国等国家经常无视国际协议，即使这些协议已经颁布，尤其是美国目前正在寻求的不具约束力的努力。瑞安的论文认为，国防部必须清楚地表明，为保护对JADC2至关重要的空间资产提供资金的必要性，国会必须批准。美国军方和文职官员公开承认，太空将在未来的冲突中成为争夺。太空部队高层领导已经开始浮现“太空优势”的概念。“这真正意味着的是承受打击并继续战斗的能力，”太空部队参谋长尼娜·M·阿尔马诺中将在9月份的AFA空中、太空和网络会议上说。该声明中缺少的是美国在太空受到攻击时直接反击的明确能力，就像它在其他领域所做的那样。瑞安是一名退休的空军中校，曾担任过各种太空角色，也曾在五角大楼的太空部队参谋中担任文职人员。他在论文中建议太空部队获得授权和资金，以“开发天基武器系统，专门设计用于防御JADC2太空运输层免受动性和非动性侵略行为。”米切尔研究所（Mitchell Institute）专家表示，尽管拜登政府通过国际规范提高太空作业安全的努力值得称赞，但美国仍需要明确的太空威慑，因为美国的对手可能愿意无视国际规范。“当前结构中的硬实力在哪里？它真的不存在，“智囊团的执行主任道格拉斯·A·比基说。“否则，我们实际上冒着太空冲突可能性增加的风险，因为他们不会关心真正的后果。”太空军成立于2019年，主要由其他军种的系统和人员组成。国会尚未通过的总统2023财政预算请求为太空部队拨款245亿美元，比2022年增加70亿美元。然而，这些预算的增加并不一定反映新的能力，因为其他服务已经将空间资产的负担和成本转移给了空间部队。根据瑞安的说法，需要更大的预算。然而，他承认将其纳入立法将是一项挑战。“当前太空部队的任何增长", "中文源标题": "米切尔研究所的新论文认为太空部队必须在JADC2中发挥主导作用", "英文整编": "Recently, Mitchell Institute published \"Indispensable Field: The Key Role of Space in Joint Global Command and Control\", saying that for decades, the budget-driven military structure has weakened the military superiority of the United States over China, and the current command and control must be developed to meet new operational needs.

Therefore, the US-Pacific Air Force should lead and supervise the integration and interoperability of the whole JADC2 system. Specific suggestions include: ① Congress should authorize the Minister of Space Operations as the design architect of the Space Force to ensure that the department is responsible for supervising the integration of the whole JADC2 system. The authorization should include defining requirements and establishing standards to integrate machine learning, optical communication, network and encryption security, software-defined networks, and distributed computing capabilities of JADC2 into the whole Department of Defense. ② Congress should provide clear guidance and funds in the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2024 to create conditions for the Space Force to develop space control regulations, tasks and capabilities. ③ Congress should require the Ministry of National Defense to report its plans to ensure that the deployment of JADC2 architecture is synchronized with the deployment of defense components of the Ministry of National Defense. ④ Congress must approve the investment of more resources, so that the space army can provide enhanced situational awareness in space airspace and develop space-based weapon systems. ⑤ The Ministry of National Defense should revise its defense strategy to meet the key requirements of JADC2 architecture. ⑥ The Ministry of National Defense should constantly review the integration of JADC2 by the Space Force to ensure that interoperability remains the top priority of JADC2. ⑦ The US-Pacific Air Force must quickly change its concept, from the promoter and provider of services to the ability to create winning effects in the space field. 8 The US-Pacific Air Force must develop actual combat training and test capabilities to drill and mature JADC2 architecture, and at the same time develop the combat skills of the Space Force."}, {"中文标题": "瑞士开发出铒掺杂光子集成放大器", "情报来源": "物理学组织网站", "时间": "2022年6月16日", "整编内容": "近日，瑞士洛桑联邦理工学院研究人员开发出铒掺杂光子集成放大器(EDFAs)。该放大器可用于长距离光纤通信电缆和光纤激光器，为光纤中的光信号功率提供增益。贝尔实验室发现传统铒掺杂放大器(EDWAs)的增益和输出功率无法与基于光纤的放大器相匹配，同时无法与当代光子集成制造技术兼容。为此，研究人员开发出一种基于氮化硅(Si3N4)光子集成电路的毫米级尺寸的铒掺杂放大器，它能够产生超过145毫瓦的输出功率，并提供超过30 分贝的信号净增益，相当于在电信频带中对信号实现了超过1000倍的放大。该研究成果在光通信、激光雷达，以及大型量子网络的量子传感器和存储器等技术领域具有极大应用价值。", "关键词": "掺铒放大器 光信号 光通信 氮化硅 ", "整编机构": "国家工业信息安全发展研究中心", "源网址": "https://phys.org/news/2022-06-photonic-erbium-doped-amplifiers-commercial.html", "源标题": "Photonic integrated erbium doped amplifiers reach commercial performance", "原文": "Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are devices that can provide gain to the optical signal power in optical fibers. They are often used in long-distance communication fiber optic cables and fiber-based lasers. Invented in the 1980s, EDFAs have profoundly impacted our information society enabling signals to be routed across the Atlantic and replacing electrical repeaters.\nWhat is interesting about erbium ions in optical communications is that they can amplify light in the 1.55 mm wavelength region, which is where silica-based optical fibers have the lowest transmission loss. The unique electronic intra-4-f shell structure of erbium—and rare-earth ions in general—enables long-lived excited states when doped inside host materials such as glass. This provides an ideal gain medium for simultaneous amplification of multiple information-carrying channels, with negligible cross-talk, high temperature stability and low noise.\nOptical amplification is also used in virtually all laser applications, from fiber sensing and frequency metrology, to industrial applications including laser-machining and LiDAR. Today, optical amplifiers based on rare-earth ions have become the workhorse for optical frequency combs, which are used to create the world's most precise atomic clocks.\nAchieving light amplification with rare-earth ions in photonic integrated circuit can transform integrated photonics. In the 1990s, Bell Laboratories was looking into erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers (EDWAs), but ultimately abandoned them because their gain and output power could not match fiber-based amplifiers, while their fabrication doesn't work with contemporary photonic integration manufacturing techniques.\nEven with the recent rise of integrated photonics, renewed efforts on EDWAs have only been able to achieve less than 1 mW output power, which is not enough for many practical applications. The problem here has been high waveguide background loss, high cooperative upconversion—a gain-limiting factor at high erbium concentration, or the long-standing challenge in achieving meter-scale waveguide lengths in compact photonic chips.\nNow, researchers at EPFL, led by Professor Tobias J. Kippenberg, have built an EDWA based on silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits of a length up to half meter on a millimeter-scale footprint, generating a record output power of more than 145 mW and providing a small-signal net gain above 30 dB, which translates to over 1000-fold amplification in the telecommunication band in continuous operation. This performance matches the commercial, high-end EDFAs, as well as state-of-the-art heterogeneously integrated III-V semiconductor amplifiers in silicon photonics.\n\"We overcame the longstanding challenge by applying ion implantation—a wafer-scale process that benefits from very low cooperative upconversion even at a very high ion concentration—to the ultralow-loss silicon nitride integrated photonic circuits,\" says Dr. Yang Liu, a researcher in Kippenberg's lab, and the lead scientist for the study published in Science.\n\"This approach allows us to achieve low loss, high erbium concentration, and a large mode-ion overlap factor in compact waveguides with meter-scale lengths, which have previously remained unsolved for decades,\" says Zheru Qiu, a Ph.D. student and co-author of the study.\n\"Operating with high output power and high gain is not a mere academic achievement; in fact, it is crucial to the practical operation of any amplifier, as it implies that any input signals can reach the power levels that are sufficient for long-distance high-speed data transmission and shot-noise limited detection; it also signals that high-pulse-energy femtosecond-lasers on a chip can finally become possible using this approach,\" says Kippenberg.\nThe breakthrough signals a renaissance of rare-earth ions as viable gain media in integrated photonics, as applications of EDWAs are virtually unlimited, from optical communications and LiDAR for autonomous driving, to quantum sensing and memories for large quantum networks. It is expected to trigger follow-up studies that cover even more rare-earth ions, offering optical gain from the visible up to the mid-infrared part of the spectrum and even higher output power.\n", "中文原文": "掺铒光纤放大器（EDFAs）是一种能够对光纤中的光信号功率提供增益的器件。它们常用于远距离通信光缆和光纤激光器。EDFAs发明于20世纪80年代，它深刻地影响了我们的信息社会，使信号能够穿越大西洋传输，并取代了电子中继器。铒离子在光通信中的有趣之处在于，它们可以放大1.55mm波长范围内的光，这是硅基光纤传输损耗最低的地方。铒离子和一般稀土离子独特的intra-4-f电子壳层结构使得在玻璃等主体材料中掺杂时能产生长寿命的激发态。这为同时放大多个信息承载信道提供了理想的增益介质，具有可忽略的串扰、高温稳定性和低噪声。从光纤传感和频率测量到工业应用，包括激光加工和激光雷达，光放大也被用于几乎所有的激光应用。今天，基于稀土离子的光放大器已经成为用于制造世界上最精确的原子钟的光频梳的主力。在光子集成电路中利用稀土离子实现光放大，可以改造集成光子学。20世纪90年代，贝尔实验室正在研究掺铒波导放大器(EDWAs)，但最终放弃了它们，因为它们的增益和输出功率无法与基于光纤的放大器相匹配，而它们的制造不适合当代光子集成制造技术。即使最近集成光子学的兴起，对EDWAs的新努力也只能实现小于1 mW的输出功率，这对于许多实际应用来说是不够的。这里的问题是高波导背景损耗、高合作上转换--高铒浓度下的增益限制因素，或者是在紧凑型光子芯片中实现米级波导长度的长期挑战。现在，由Tobias J.Kippenberg教授领导的EPFL的研究人员已经基于氮化硅(Si3N4)光子集成电路构建了一个EDWA，其长度可达半米，占地毫米级，产生了超过145毫瓦的创纪录输出功率，并提供了超过30分贝的小信号净增益，这相当于在电信频段连续运行时的1000倍以上的放大。这种性能与商用高端EDFA以及硅光子学中最先进的异质集成III-V半导体放大器相匹配。Kippenberg实验室的研究人员、发表在《科学》杂志上的这项研究的首席科学家杨柳博士说：“我们通过将离子注入应用到超低损耗氮化硅集成光子电路中，克服了长期的挑战--一种晶片规模的过程，即使在非常高的离子浓度下，也可以从非常低的合作上转换中受益。”“这种方法使我们能够在米级长度的紧凑型波导中实现低损耗、高铒浓度和大模离子重叠系数，这些问题以前几十年来一直没有解决，”该研究的合著者、博士生Zheru Qu说。“以高输出功率和高增益工作不仅仅是学术成就；事实上，它对任何放大器的实际操作都至关重要，因为它意味着任何输入信号都可以达到足以进行长距离高速数据传输和散粒噪声有限检测的功率水平；它还表明，使用这种方法，芯片上的高脉冲能量飞秒激光最终可能成为可能，”Kippenberg说。这一突破标志着稀土离子作为集成光子学中可行的增益介质的复兴，因为EDWAs的应用实际上是无限的，从用于自动驾驶的光通信和激光雷达，到用于大型量子网络的量子传感和存储器。它有望引发后续研究，涵盖更多的稀土离子，提供从可见光到中红外光谱的光学增益，以及更高的输出功率。", "中文源标题": "光子集成掺铒放大器达到商用性能", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers from the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland developed erbium-doped photonic integrated amplifiers (EDFAs).

The team's results were recently published in Results in Surfaces and Interfaces outlining how the high versality of Diamond's B18 beamline allowed them to perform X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy on their samples and compare the results with their predictive models.\nThe researchers already have a patent for this material for arsenic decontamination and they hope that the new material might be incorporated into a filtration column for everyday use in affected households, as this cheap and efficient technology could improve the quality of water for millions of people. .\nFirst author of the publication, Dr. Jay Bullen explains, \"These experiments allowed us to directly investigate the structure of the surface complexes formed when arsenic binds to our TiO2/Fe2O3 nanomaterial. We were able to conclude that the surface complexes we had chosen for our predictive surface complexation model, using pure titania and pure iron oxide reference materials, were appropriate.\"\n\"However, we also saw some tridentate As-Fe2O3 bonding in the EXAFS data that wasn't included within our earlier model. We were also able to confirm surface precipitation of As(III) at low pH, which our model had predicted.\"\nArsenic is a famously toxic element and long-term exposure to even trace amounts can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal diseases including skin cancer, lung cancer, keratosis, and neurological disorders. 100-200 million people globally are believed to be exposed to arsenic through contaminated groundwater drinking supplies. Water multi-step treatments to remove arsenic already exist, using filtration (adsorption), but this process requires pre-treatment (oxidation) to be efficient .\nDr. Jay Bullen says, \"We wanted to better understand the nature of arsenic adsorbed onto this composite TiO2/Fe2O3 nanomaterial; to understand whether arsenic binds in the same way as onto pure TiO2 and pure Fe2O3 minerals.\"\n\"X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is the perfect way to do this, with EXAFS revealing information about the local environment of arsenic atoms, e.g. how many covalent bonds arsenic forms with the TiO2/Fe2O3 surface. The beamtime grant we received allowed us to realize these experiments at Diamond Lightsource.\"\nSpectroscopic observations to confirm a predictive model\nArsenic can be found in several forms in water including arsenite and arsenate. Arsenite (i.e. As(III)) ions are difficult to remove from contaminated water using conventional treatments such as adsorption or coagulation-flocculation due to its neutral charge (H3AsO3). In contrast, arsenate (i.e. As(V)) ions (HAsO42- and H2AsO4-) are both (i) more easily adsorbed and (ii) less toxic than H3AsO3.\nConsequently, the treatment of As(III)-contaminated water benefits from the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) prior to its removal via adsorption. Oxidation of As(III) can be achieved using heterogeneous photocatalysts, such as TiO2, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, other materials such as iron oxides (Fe2O3) are more efficient for adsorption. Therefore multiple-step treatment plants are currently used but their design and maintainance is challenging.\nThis difficulty may be overcome by incorporating photocatalytic and adsorption capabilities into a single material. Previous studies by the same group showed that composite materials combining the excellent photocatalytic capabilities of TiO2 with the high As(V) adsorption capacities of iron oxides (Fe2O3) were good candidates for efficient decontamination.\nThe authors subsequently developed a surface complexation model (SCM) to predict changes in the amount of arsenic adsorbed and its speciation as a function of experimental variables such as pH.\nHowever, the authors wanted to verify that the structures of the adsorbed arsenic surface complexes chosen for the model were realistic, so they used spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy played a key role thanks to its element selectivity, its capability to discriminate As oxidation state (XANES) and to identify the structure of the As complexes adsorbed on the TiO2/Fe2O3 surface (EXAFS).\nThe team used B18 to realize their experiments. At the beamline, they were able to record EXAFS spectra of solid samples to determine how many covalent bonds arsenic forms with the surface of the materials, and XANES spectra of aqueous suspensions to measure photooxidation kinetics.\nThe authors combined spectroscopic data obtained at Diamond Lightsource (EXAFS) with FTIR and zeta potential measurements at Imperial College London to develop a picture of the dominant surface complexes formed when arsenic is adsorbed by TiO2/Fe2O3 composite nanomaterials.\nThis was used to evaluate and verify the speciation of adsorbed arsenic predicted by the authors' previous Surface Complexation Model (SCM), a theoretical model that is able to predict changes in adsorption as a function of environmental conditions. This model had been developed using surface complexes chosen based on data for pure titania and pure iron oxides, with experimental evidence for arsenic speciation on composite TiO2/Fe2O3 not being available prior to the Diamond Lightsource study.\n", "中文原文": "由Dominik Weiss教授领导的伦敦帝国理工学院的一个研究小组一直在与英国国家同步加速器金刚石光源合作，研究一种将光催化氧化和吸附结合在一起的新材料(TiO2/Fe2O3纳米材料），这种材料可以一步处理受污染的水。南亚有5000多万人暴露在被致癌砷污染的地下水中。该团队的结果最近发表在《表面和界面的结果》上，概述了钻石B18波束线的高度通用性如何使他们能够对样本进行X射线吸收光谱，并将结果与预测模型进行比较。研究人员已经拥有这种砷净化材料的专利，他们希望这种新材料可以被纳入受影响家庭的日常使用过滤柱，因为这种廉价高效的技术可以改善数百万人的水质。.该出版物的第一作者杰伊·布伦博士解释说：“这些实验使我们能够直接研究砷与TiO2/Fe2O3纳米材料结合时形成的表面络合物的结构。我们能够得出结论，我们选择的用于预测表面络合物模型的表面络合物，使用纯二氧化钛和纯氧化铁参考材料，是合适的。”“然而，我们在EXAFS数据中也看到了一些三齿As-Fe2O3键，这是我们早期模型中没有包括的。我们还能够证实低pH下As(III)的表面沉淀，这是我们模型预测的。”砷是一种著名的有毒元素，长期暴露在微量的环境中会导致衰弱和潜在的致命疾病，包括皮肤癌、肺癌、角化病和神经疾病。据信，全球有1亿至2亿人通过受污染的地下水饮用水接触砷。去除水中砷的多步处理已经存在，使用过滤（吸附），但这一过程需要预处理（氧化）才能有效。Jay Bullen博士说：“我们想更好地理解吸附在这种复合TiO2/Fe2O3纳米材料上的砷的性质；理解砷是否以与纯TiO2和纯Fe2O3矿物相同的方式结合。”X射线吸收光谱(XAS)是实现这一目标的最佳方法，EXAFS揭示了砷原子的局域环境信息，例如，砷与TiO2/Fe2O3表面形成了多少共价键。我们获得的光束时间授权使我们能够在金刚石光源上实现这些实验。证实预测模型的光谱观测砷在水中以几种形式存在，包括亚砷酸盐和砷酸盐。砷酸盐（即As(III)）离子由于含有中性电荷(H3AsO3)，很难用吸附或混凝等常规处理方法从污染水体中去除。相比之下，砷酸盐（即As(V)）离子(HAsO42-和H2AsO4-)比H3AsO3更容易被吸附，毒性更小。因此，在通过吸附去除As(III)之前，将As(III)氧化成As(V)有利于处理受As(III)污染的水。As(III)的氧化可以使用多相光催化剂如TiO2和紫外(UV)辐射来实现。然而，其他材料如氧化铁(Fe2O3)的吸附效率更高。因此，目前采用多级处理设备，但其设计和维护具有挑战性。这种困难可以通过将光催化和吸附能力结合到一种单一的材料中来克服。同组以前的研究表明，将TiO2优异的光催化性能和铁氧化物(Fe2O3)高的As(V)吸附能力相结合的复合材料是高效去污的良好候选材料。作者随后开发了表面络合模型(SCM)，以预测砷吸附量及其形态随实验变量如pH的变化。然而，作者想要验证吸附的砷表面络合物的结构是真实的，所以他们使用了光谱技术。X射线吸收光谱技术以其对元素的选择性、对As氧化态的鉴别能力和对吸附在TiO2/Fe2O3表面的As配合物的结构的鉴别能力而发挥了重要作用。该小组使用B18来实现他们的实验。在光束线上，他们能够记录固体样品的EXAFS光谱，以确定砷与材料表面形成了多少共价键，并记录水悬浮液的XANES光谱，以测量光氧化动力学。作者将在钻石光源(EXAFS)获得的光谱数据与伦敦帝国理工学院的FTIR和zeta电位测量相结合，开发了一幅占主导地位的surfa图像", "中文源标题": "一步法水除砷的研究", "英文整编": "Recently, Imperial College London and Diamond Light Source Research Institute used composite nanomaterials based on titanium dioxide and iron oxide to purify arsenic, and combined with the principles of photocatalysis, oxidation and adsorption, realized the step-by-step treatment of polluted wastewater.

The researchers improved the traditional method by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and developed a one-step wastewater treatment method that can be used to purify arsenic. Among them, the fine structure of X-ray absorption spectrum is mainly used to reveal the local environmental information of arsenic atoms. During the experiment, the researchers first oxidized arsenite (arsenic III) in wastewater into arsenate (arsenic V), which can greatly reduce the toxicity of arsenic. Then, arsenic can be removed from polluted wastewater in one step by combining photocatalysis and adsorption capacity into a single material. Finally, based on the surface complex data of pure titanium dioxide and pure iron oxide, the researchers developed a surface complex model that can predict the change of arsenic adsorption amount and its morphology.

Now, Princeton researchers have developed an inexpensive, sustainable way to make new batteries from used ones and have spun off a company to scale up the innovation.\n\"What we see is that people would be willing to give us their dead batteries that are currently just sitting around. They receive back from us new pristine cathode materials for new batteries cheaper than they could manufacture on their own,\" said Chao Yan, cofounder and CEO of Princeton NuEnergy and a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.\nPrinceton NuEnergy uses a process developed by researchers who combined expertise from diverse fields to solve a longstanding problem: how to turn spent cathode materials, or the expensive part of a lithium-ion battery, which contain elements such as cobalt, nickel, manganese and lithium, into pristine new cathodes. Current technologies for recycling lithium-ion batteries rely on harsh chemicals and high-temperature, energy-intensive processes to break down spent batteries to their elemental components. These processes have been challenging to scale up commercially and in an environmentally viable way. Instead, Princeton NuEnergy is upgrading and renewing the cathodes themselves in a form of direct recycling.\nThe team's method recovers much of the structure and composition of the used cathode, along with cobalt and lithium. The method for generating fresh cathode material reduces water use by approximately 70%, and energy use and emissions by 80%, according to the researchers.\nXiaofang Yang, who was an associate research scholar at Princeton, led the technology development and is a cofounder and CTO of the company. Yiguang Ju, the Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and Bruce Koel, professor of chemical and biological engineering, are cofounders and serve as technology advisors.\nAt the heart of the team's process is the use of low-temperature plasma, an ionized gas that is extremely reactive. Because of this reactivity, plasma can be used to carry out chemical reactions to remove contaminants from the cathode powder that would otherwise require very high temperatures and would largely decompose the material. The Princeton NuEnergy team cleans up the cathode material without destroying it. Their method involves mechanically separating the cathode and anode materials and running the cathode powder through a plasma reactor to remove contamination produced from using the batteries.\nHistorically, recycling has involved mechanically shredding and smelting the battery materials to strip out individual elements or dissolving the batteries in a vat of strong acid. The acid-based processes result in a soup of metals, casting out all the work that went into producing the cathode in the first place. These methods are considered indirect because they involve breaking the battery materials down into their elemental components, rather than reforming and regenerating them into new versions of themselves.\n\"Acid breaks everything down to ground zero,\" said Yan.\n\"If you have a piece of dough, you may try to gently knead it and give it a different structure. But basically, you are leaving it alone. You are not destroying it or breaking it back into the flour and butter,\" said Koel.\nKoel said used batteries have lost some lithium out of the cathode material during their lifetime, so Princeton NuEnergy adds back small amounts of lithium into their regenerated cathode powder, producing cheaper materials than required for wholly new cathodes. Scaling up this process could not only help mitigate some of the supply chain issues around importing foreign minerals, but it would also reduce demand for minerals from over-mined areas where environmental and labor issues are rampant. Much of the world's cobalt, for example, a key ingredient in the cathodes, is found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where mining often involves child labor.\nThe team is looking to scale up production to see if the process works for producing tons instead of kilograms of cathode material. The company recently started a pilot project with Taiwan-based Wistron Greentech (Texas) Corporation, a major waste processor for technology companies. Princeton NuEnergy is currently building a processing line at Wistron Greentech's facility in McKinney, Texas. With this partnership, the company plans to ramp up production to at least a ton per day during 2022.\n\"Scaleup is always a challenge. It's one thing to do it in a beaker, and another thing doing it in a vat the size of your office,\" said Koel. \"We can't do this fast by ourselves. Wistron had an empty manufacturing line and so they were very interested in hearing our proposal.\"\nKoel said there is some clever science and engineering that the cofounders developed for their process, including how to utilize the plasma and operate the reactor. The team hopes they can scale up production rapidly because there is intense interest in the battery recycling space and companies with competing technologies are likely to spring up.\nThe researchers said only about 5% of used lithium-ion batteries are currently recycled in the United States. And according to Princeton's Net-Zero America study, reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century would mean the number of electric vehicles would increase from about one million on the road today to between 210 to 330 million. Electric vehicle batteries have a lifetime of five to 10 years, and there are about 3,000 battery cells per vehicle, depending on the model. Analysis from IHC Markit estimates there are currently around 10 billion or about 465,000 tons of used electric vehicle batteries in need of processing, and expects that number to grow to 29 billion by 2025.\n\"We aren't just a startup with an idea. We think there is a massive opportunity to transfer our technology into a real industrial project that will allow us to recycle and repurpose lithium-ion batteries at scale,\" said Yan.\nAt the Wistron plant, a former manufacturing line that was used to reclaim gold from the printed circuit boards of electronics will be converted to a battery recycling line using the Princeton NuEnergy process, which showcases a shift in the market from demand for gold to the minerals in lithium-ion batteries like lithium and cobalt. The researchers said they hope that within a couple of years they can continue to increase recycling capacity and expand out of consumer electronics batteries and into electric vehicle batteries, and perhaps even expand into whole-battery manufacturing using their regenerated materials.\nChao is also experimenting with alternative plasma approaches to make sure there are no better reactors to use.\n\"The performance of our regenerated cathodes in small coin cell battery tests is excellent, but at the end of the day, we are going to have independent third parties say 'We took their materials from them and we made these batteries, and these batteries work great.' That's the next step,\" said Koel.\n", "中文原文": "数十亿个死掉的锂离子电池，包括许多来自电动汽车的电池，正在积累，因为没有成本效益高的方法来恢复它们。现在，普林斯顿大学的研究人员开发了一种廉价、可持续的方法，用旧电池制造新电池，并剥离了一家公司来扩大创新。“我们看到的是，人们愿意把他们现在闲置的没电电池给我们。普林斯顿NuEnergy的联合创始人兼首席执行官、机械和航空航天工程系博士后研究员赵岩说：”他们从我们这里得到新电池的原始正极材料，比他们自己制造的要便宜。“普林斯顿NuEnergy使用了一种由研究人员开发的方法，这些研究人员结合了不同领域的专业知识，以解决一个长期存在的问题：如何将废弃的正极材料或锂离子电池的昂贵部分，包括钴、镍、锰和锂等元素，转化为原始的新正极。目前回收锂离子电池的技术依赖于苛刻的化学物质和高温、高能耗的过程来将废旧电池分解为元素成分。这些工艺在商业上和以一种环境可行的方式扩大规模方面一直是一项挑战。相反，普林斯顿NuEnergy正在以直接回收的形式升级和更新阴极本身。该团队的方法回收了使用过的阴极的大部分结构和成分，以及钴和锂。根据研究人员的说法，产生新阴极材料的方法减少了大约70%的水使用，减少了80%的能源使用和排放。杨小方曾是普林斯顿大学的副研究员，领导了该公司的技术开发，是该公司的联合创始人和CTO。Jui Guang是机械和航空航天工程的Robert Porter Patterson教授和化学和生物工程的Bruce Koel教授，是联合创始人并担任技术顾问。该团队的核心过程是使用低温等离子体，这是一种极具反应性的电离气体。由于这种反应性，等离子体可以用来进行化学反应，以去除阴极粉末中的污染物，否则这些污染物需要非常高的温度，并将材料大量分解。普林斯顿NuEnergy团队在不破坏正极材料的情况下清理了正极材料。他们的方法包括机械分离阴极和阳极材料，并通过等离子体反应器运行阴极粉末，以去除使用电池产生的污染。历史上，回收利用涉及机械粉碎和熔炼电池材料，以剥离单个元素，或将电池溶解在强酸缸中。酸基工艺的结果是一团金属，把最初生产阴极的所有工作都赶了出来。这些方法被认为是间接的，因为它们涉及将电池材料分解成元素成分，而不是将它们改造和再生成新的版本。“酸把一切都打碎了，”严说。“如果你有一块面团，你可以试着轻轻地揉搓它，给它一个不同的结构。但基本上，你是在让它独处。你没有破坏它，也没有把它打碎成面粉和黄油，”科尔说。柯尔说，废旧电池在寿命期间从正极材料中损失了一些锂，所以普林斯顿NuEnergy在再生的正极粉末中添加了少量锂，生产出比全新正极所需的更便宜的材料。扩大这一进程不仅有助于缓解围绕进口外国矿产的一些供应链问题，而且还将减少对环境和劳工问题猖獗的过度开采地区的矿产需求。例如，世界上大部分钴是阴极的关键成分，产于刚果民主共和国，那里的采矿经常涉及童工。该小组正在扩大生产规模，看看该工艺是否能生产吨级而不是公斤级的阴极材料。该公司最近与总部位于台湾的纬创绿色科技（德克萨斯）公司启动了一个试点项目，该公司是科技公司的主要废物处理商。普林斯顿NuEnergy目前正在纬创绿泰克位于德克萨斯州麦金尼的工厂建设一条加工生产线。通过这种合作关系，该公司计划在2022年期间将产量提高到每天至少一吨。“扩大规模总是一个挑战。科尔说：”在烧杯里做是一回事，在办公室大小的大桶里做是另一回事。““我们自己做不到这么快。纬创有一条空的生产线，所以他们对听到我们的提议非常感兴趣。”Koel说联合创始人为thei开发了一些聪明的科学和工程", "中文源标题": "初创公司旨在快速追踪锂电池回收", "英文整编": "Recently, Princeton University in the United States has developed a new method of recycling used batteries at low cost, which can make new batteries from used batteries.

In the new method, the cathode and anode materials of waste batteries are separated mechanically at first, and then the cathode powder is chemically reacted through a plasma reactor to remove the pollution caused by using batteries. Researchers say that waste batteries will lose some lithium from cathode materials during their life, so a small amount of lithium is added to recycled cathode powder to produce cheaper materials than new cathodes.

This was done using the new RF-7800H-MP radios from L3 Harris, which are natively integrated into VidStream. Because of this arrangement, the Seeker UAS was the only system to relay video from its ground position to the control station.\nThis UAV, developed and produced by GMV and Aurea Avionics, is currently one of the most efficient systems in the Class I Mini segment, with an endurance of 90 minutes, a range of 15 km and a weight of 3.5 kg. Both the Spanish Navy and the Spanish Army received the first Seeker UAS units to reinforce the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities of the Marine Infantry Protection Force and the Spanish Army’s “Almogávares” VI Paratrooper Brigade, two units that enjoy international prestige as elite forces.\n", "中文原文": "2022年3月10日海军陆战队步兵旅(BRIMAR)是Tercio de Armada de Infantería de Marina（海军陆战队步兵保护部队）的一部分，在FTX-BRIMAR21演习期间，于12月9日至13日在萨拉戈萨的圣格雷戈里奥国家训练中心部署了其导引头飞机。探索者无人机在这场战役中被证明是一项至关重要的资产，在这场战役中，通过威胁识别、跟踪车辆和其他目标以及评估地形、路线和定居点来收集情报是必不可少的。导引头系统参与了RAPAZ计划下的这些演习，该计划由规划、技术和创新总局领导，该总局向西班牙武器和材料总局报告。在这些要求特别高的实弹演习中，导引头无人机展示了它的能力。布里马尔部队能够充分利用该系统的自主性和航程，从有利的地点进行行动，即使在非常不利的天气条件下，地面风速超过40节，并在能见度很低或为零的条件下安排自主起飞和着陆，包括夜间飞行。尽管环境复杂，导引头无人机能够顺利部署，并使布里马号能够白天和晚上定位目标，因为它有双重有效载荷，配有热和可见相机。这有助于演习的成功。在演习期间，导引头无人机处理了可用的数据源，以补充视频，为所有部署的部队提供信息，而不仅仅是系统操作员：生成的视频和数据使用VidStream（一种安全、高质量、无延迟的视频和数据传输系统）实时分发到BRIMAR控制站。这是使用新的RF-7800H-MP无线电从L3哈里斯，这是本地集成到VidStream。由于这种安排，导引头无人机系统是唯一一个将视频从其地面位置中继到控制站的系统。这款无人机由GMV和Aurea航空电子公司研发生产，是目前I类迷你航段中效率最高的系统之一，续航时间90分钟，航程15公里，重量3.5公斤。西班牙海军和西班牙陆军都接收了第一批搜索者无人机部队，以加强海军陆战队步兵保护部队和西班牙陆军“阿尔莫加瓦雷斯”第六伞兵旅的情报、监视和侦察能力，这两个部队作为精英部队享有国际声誉。", "中文源标题": "西班牙海军探索者无人机通过包括实弹在内的演习", "英文整编": "From December 9 to 13, 2021, the FTX-BRIMAR 21 exercise was held at the San Gregorio National Training Center in Zaragoza, and the Spanish Marine Corps Infantry Brigade used the Seeker UAV to complete the drill including live-fire shooting."}, {"中文标题": "诺格公司演示“高容量骨干”网关对于联合全域指挥控制的支撑能力", "情报来源": "美国诺格公司网站", "时间": "2021年8月17日", "整编内容": "诺格公司成功进行先进网关系统开放式架构验证，展示了该公司网关系统的“高容量骨干”（HCB）通信能力。“高容量骨干”网关项目进展迅速，在一年时间内由概念快速转变成为现实。基于诺格公司“高容量骨干”网关解决方案，通过在现有数据链和人工智能增强网络之间融入网关转换能力，诺格公司能够在较短时间（不到一周时间内），快速集成/演示一种高速/安全/开放/平台解耦的全域互联能力，支撑美军联合全域指挥控制（JADC2）概念的发展/应用。下一代“高容量骨干”网关能够使数据流传输速度提升300倍，构建美国国防部所需的先进网络架构。（航空工业信息中心 石峰 供稿 陈珊珊 审核）", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "航空工业信息中心", "源网址": "https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-demonstrates-open-architecture-high-speed-connectivity", "源标题": "Proof of concept demonstration integrates high-speed connectivity system with L3Harris high-speed processing capability", "原文": "August 17, 2021 \nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC) has validated the open architecture nature of its advanced gateway system offering by successfully integrating and demonstrating a new High Capacity Backbone (HCB) capability provided by L3Harris Technologies with one of Northrop Grumman’s platform agnostic gateway systems.

BothBlackSkyandPlanetare now publicly traded.\nO’Toole said the company last week submitted a bid for a National Reconnaissance Office imagery contract that the agency plans to award in mid-2022 to multiple commercial providers.\nThe NRO, which currently buys most of its commercial satellite imagery from Maxar, is expected to select new providers to diversify its supplier base.\n“We feel we’re really well positioned to get a good portion of that contract,” said O’Toole.\nThe NRO said one of the products it wants to buy is “taskable” imagery. That means the customer takes the reins of a commercial satellite to shoot imagery of any given location at any time. “They want to be able to control when and where they get information,” said O’Toole. “So our ability to put the joystick, so to speak, in the hands of our customers is really important.”\nBlackSky also expects to increase sales of data analytics services to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency which recently announced plans to rely more on commercial providers.\nThe U.S. Space Force and the Space Development Agency are potential customers as well, but the industry is still waiting for a “demand signal” from military buyers, O’Toole said. “We believe there’s tremendous partnership opportunities with these new agencies to accelerate what they want to do.”\n", "中文原文": "Bysandra Erwin-2021年12月13日华盛顿--卫星图像和数据分析提供商BlackSky在过去30天里以三种不同的方式发射了六颗卫星。BlackSky首席执行官布莱恩·奥图尔（Brian O'Toole)表示，目前有12颗卫星在轨，该公司计划明年再增加两四颗，然后在2023年过渡到更高分辨率的航天器。在一次失败的火箭实验室任务中损失了两艘航天器后，达到12颗卫星是该公司的一个关键目标。奥图尔告诉SpaceNews，明年的发射将放缓，2022年星座可能只会增加两到四颗卫星。该公司将继续使用火箭实验室和SpaceX进行发射服务。BlackSky最初计划在2022年开始部署其新的Gen-3卫星，但现在的目标是在2023年首次发射。Gen-3卫星将产生50厘米分辨率的图像，而目前的Gen-2版本只能提供一米分辨率的图像。奥图尔说，长期目标是一个由30颗卫星组成的星座。奥图尔说，图像市场目前“供应受限”，因为对数据和洞察力的需求越来越大，尤其是来自美国政府和情报机构的需求。该公司目前的一些卫星可以每天15次捕捉同一地点的图像，这有助于跟踪经济趋势和监控国家安全机构感兴趣的领域。七年前进入市场的BlackSky正在与Planet等老牌公司竞争，并在遥感行业面临新兴竞争对手。“在我看来，这仍然是一个供应受限的市场”，有许多竞争对手的空间，奥图尔说。“我们看到了对快速重访图像和数据分析的强劲需求”。投资者对卫星图像业务的公司表现出了兴趣。BothBlacksky、Planetet，现在都公开交易了。奥图尔说，该公司上周提交了一份国家侦察办公室图像合同的投标，该机构计划在2022年年中授予多个商业提供商。NRO目前从Maxar购买大部分商业卫星图像，预计将选择新的供应商，以使其供应商基础多样化。“我们觉得我们真的很有能力获得合同的很大一部分，”奥图尔说。NRO表示，它想购买的产品之一是“可定制”的图像。这意味着客户掌握着商业卫星的缰绳，在任何时间拍摄任何给定位置的图像。“他们希望能够控制他们何时何地获得信息，”奥图尔说。“所以我们把操纵杆放在客户手中的能力真的很重要。”BlackSky还预计将增加对美国国家地理空间情报局（National Geospace Intelligence Agency）的数据分析服务销售，后者最近宣布计划更多地依赖商业提供商。奥图尔说，美国太空部队和太空发展署也是潜在客户，但该行业仍在等待军事买家的“需求信号”。“我们认为，与这些新机构有巨大的合作机会，可以加快他们想做的事情。”", "中文源标题": "BlackSky将于2023年开始向高分辨率成像卫星过渡", "英文整编": "BlackSky, a satellite image and data analyzer, has launched six satellites in the past 30 days.

To fully exploit the potential of this technique, however, requires a way to optically stimulate specific regions throughout the entire brain.\nWith this aim, a research team headed up in Japan has developed a flexible microLED array film that can adhere to the brain surface and illuminate individual or multiple brain regions for optogenetic stimulation. The researchers describe the device in Applied Physics Express.\nTo create the bioimplantable stimulation device, first author Hiroto Sekiguchi from Toyohashi University of Technology developed a way to precisely pattern a layer of microLEDs on an ultrathin flexible film. Sekiguchi and colleagues selected the biocompatible polymer parylene C as the base film, due to its robustness and flexibility. Their first task was to determine the optimal film thickness to balance bendability against fragility. Wrapping experiments investigating the effect of the radius of curvature on film adhesion revealed that a parylene thickness of 11 ?m provided sufficient adhesion and robustness.\nNext, the researchers established a method for fabricating a high-density, hollow-structured array of indium gallium nitride (InGaN)-based microLEDs. They arranged the 80 x 80 ?m microLEDs, which emit 450 nm light, in a 7 × 6 array on a 1 mm square. The hollow structure separates the LED layer from its substrate, enabling the use of a thermal release sheet to transfer a layer of microLEDs onto a parylene film, without rotation or misalignment.\nThe film-mounted microLEDs generated bright blue emission, which was maintained even when the film was bent. Comparisons of the current–voltage characteristics before and after the transfer process showed that the process had not affected the microLED performance.\nOptogenetic investigations require light output values in the range 0.1–1 mW/mm2 to activate channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2, the first widely adopted optogenetics tool). The researchers note that driving a single microLED at 0.5 mA generated blue light with an output of 22 mW/mm2.\nTo determine the safety of the optical stimulation with regard to tissue heating, the researchers calculated the temperature increase for a light output of roughly 10 mW/mm2. They observed an increase of 1.6 °C in air – less than the maximum value specified in guidelines for embedded devices (2 °C), suggesting that the device would be safe to use in vivo.\nFinally, to test the functionality of the flexible microLED array film, the team placed a film on the surface of the cerebral cortex in an anaesthetized mouse. The 11 μm thick film adhered well to the surface of the brain. Simultaneously driving three microLEDs generated three bright blue emission spots.\nExamining the extent of light penetration into the animal’s brain, using electroluminescence measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, revealed that the brain region 100–250 μm away from the surface could be stimulated with 10 mW/cm2 of blue light. This indicates that the flexible microLED film should be effective for optogenetic stimulation.\nSekiguchi tells Physics World that the team now plans to develop technology for integrating microLEDs and neural electrodes, which can measure brain waves via electroencephalography. “Also, we think that the next challenge is to integrate microLEDs with different emission colours,” he adds.\n“The development of flexible microLED films can significantly contribute to the field of neuroscience research, particularly optogenetic research for the purpose of functional dissection of sub-regions on the brain surface,” the researchers conclude.\n", "中文原文": "光遗传学--利用光来操纵大脑中的神经元--可以帮助科学家更好地理解大脑功能的机制，以及神经活动和大脑疾病是如何联系在一起的。然而，要充分开发这项技术的潜力，需要一种方法来光学刺激整个大脑的特定区域。基于这一目标，一个由日本领导的研究小组开发了一种柔性microLED阵列薄膜，可以附着在大脑表面，照亮单个或多个大脑区域，以进行光遗传刺激。研究人员在《应用物理快报》上描述了这种装置。为了创造生物植入刺激装置，第一作者丰桥工业大学的Hiroto Sekiguchi开发了一种方法，在超薄柔性薄膜上精确地形成一层微发光二极管。Sekiguchi和他的同事选择生物相容性聚合物parylene C作为基膜，因为它的坚固性和灵活性。他们的第一个任务是确定最佳薄膜厚度，以平衡弯曲性和脆性。缠绕实验研究了曲率半径对薄膜附着力的影响，结果表明，二甲苯厚度为11m时，薄膜具有足够的附着力和坚固性。接下来，研究人员建立了一种制造高密度空心结构氮化铟镓（InGaN）基微发光二极管阵列的方法。他们将发射450纳米光的80×80米微米发光二极管以7×6的阵列排列在1毫米见方的面积上。中空结构将LED层与其衬底分开，使得能够使用热释放片将微LED层转移到聚对二甲苯膜上，而不会旋转或失调。安装在薄膜上的微发光二极管产生明亮的蓝色发射，即使薄膜弯曲也保持不变。通过比较转移前后的电流-电压特性，发现转移过程对微LED的性能没有影响。光遗传学研究需要0.1-1mW/mm2范围内的光输出值来激活通道视紫红质-2(ChR2，第一个被广泛采用的光遗传学工具）。研究人员指出，以0.5毫安驱动单个microLED会产生输出为22毫瓦/毫米的蓝光。为了确定光学刺激对组织加热的安全性，研究人员计算了大约10毫瓦/毫米2的光输出的温度增加。他们观察到空气中增加了1.6°C，低于嵌入式设备指南规定的最大值(2°C)，这表明该设备在体内使用是安全的。最后，为了测试柔性microLED阵列薄膜的功能，研究小组在一只麻醉小鼠的大脑皮层表面放置了一层薄膜。11微米厚的薄膜很好地粘附在脑表面。同时驱动三个微发光二极管产生三个明亮的蓝色发射点。利用电致发光测量和蒙特卡罗模拟来检查光对动物大脑的穿透程度，发现离表面100-250微米的大脑区域可以被10毫瓦/平方厘米的蓝光刺激。这表明柔性microLED膜应该是有效的光遗传刺激。Sekiguchi告诉《物理世界》，该团队现在计划开发集成微发光二极管和神经电极的技术，可以通过脑电图测量脑电波。“此外，我们认为下一个挑战是集成不同发射颜色的微发光二极管，”他补充道。研究人员总结说：“柔性微LED薄膜的开发可以极大地有助于神经科学研究领域，特别是用于大脑表面子区域功能解剖的光遗传学研究。”", "中文源标题": "超薄植入式microLED阵列照亮大脑", "英文整编": "Recently, a research team LED by Toyahashi University of Technology in Japan developed a flexible implantable LED light stimulation film device, which can be attached to the brain surface to perform light genetic stimulation on single or multiple brain regions, helping scientists better understand the brain function mechanism and the relationship between neural activity and brain diseases.

The hollow structure of the film can separate it from the base film and make it adhere to the substrate accurately without rotation or dislocation. Researchers say that once the LED film installed on the basement film produces bright blue emission light, it can maintain this emission state even when the film is bent.

USAF said it prefers to spend that money on other needed modernization programs and wait until the Block 4 version of the jet is ready. The unfunded priorities list looks to close that gap slightly, asking for $921 million for seven more strike fighters, bringing the service’s total 2023 buy to 40 F-35As—still eight fewer than what it bought in 2022.\nThe UPL, which was obtained by Air Force Magazine but not released by the department, lists eight priorities the service wants but couldn’t afford in its 2023 budget request,released last month. The F-35 is fifth on that list.\n“The Air Force unfunded list would add just seven F-35 jets, less than half of what’s needed to match the 48 requested in each of the past three years,” said Air & Space Forces Association president retired Lt. Gen. Bruce Wright. “Indeed, in 2020 and 2021, Congress increased the Air Force request from 48 to 60 and we would urge lawmakers to do the same in 2023.”\nIn fiscal 2022, the Air Force asked for another dozen F-15EXs as part of that year’s $4.2 billionunfunded priorities list,but it did not ask for any additional F-35A strike fighters—a departure from previous years.\nThe Space Force offered Congress its own $6 million unfunded priorities list. More than half that request ($327 million) would go to classified programs, while the rest would be split between more resilient missile warning and missile tracking ($200 million) and weapons systems sustainment ($112 million).\nWeapons system sustainment is the Air Force’s No. 1 unfunded priority. The service requested $579 million, which it said would support its “highest priority” depot programs, including the B-52, F-16, T-38, C-17, Battle Management System, C-5, and the Distributed Common Ground System.\nListed as its second-highest wish—though the biggest ask financially—is a request for $978.5 million to procure four moreEC-37B Compass Callelectronic warfare aircraft, which would bring the total fleet to 10 aircraft.\nOther requests, listed in order of priority, include:\n$397 millionto repair, replace, or restore “facilities damaged by inadequate sustainment, excessive age, natural disaster, fire, accident, or other causes, or to alter or replace facilities to implement new or higher standards, accommodate new functions, or replace building components that typically last more than 50 years.” The UPL did not list specific locations. $276 millionfor additional Small Diameter Bomb IIs, which the service says suffers from diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages for weapon procurement. Standoff munitions, such as the AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile series tookpriority in the Air Force’s 2023 budget request, which looks to buy 550 extended range JASSMs and 28 Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile variants. Meanwhile, the 2023 budget request asked to procure 761 SDB II bombs, also known as the StormBreaker, down from 985 units in 2022. The F-35 request of$921 millionwould restore some of the aircraft subtracted from the yet-to-be-awarded Lot 17, which will have Block 4 capability. In aninterview with Air Force Magazineshortly after the budget release, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs, Lt. Gen. David S. Nahom, said the Air Force would buy more F-35s if resources allowed, but given the delay with Block 4, the Air Force opted to speed up the F-15EX buy, while also freeing up some money to help pay the multi-billion nuclear modernization bill. $749 millionfor at least 26 military construction projects across the globe, ranging from new child development centers to simulators to a military working dog kennel. The biggest portion of that ask ($286 million) would fund ongoing natural disaster recovery at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., and Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va. Another large chunk, $114 million, would fund a KC-46A bay in the depot corrosion control hangar at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. $197 millionfor hypersonic testing with B-52s, F-15s, F-16s, and “tanker ops” at two locations, adding contractor capacity and absorbing the mounting workload. Specifically, the UPL asks for $55 million to enable “open-air hypersonic testing,” which “expands high fidelity coverage for extreme velocities beyond 350 [nautical miles] allowing for more shots of longer distance and duration.” The funds also would help “close capability gaps for hypersonics intercept, reusable vehicles, boost glide, and stores separation,” according to the document. $516 millionto restore readiness spares packages, which the service says are “critically below required readiness levels” after 20 years of Middle East contingency operations. RSP kits are tailored to specific aircraft variants and are intended to provide support for 30 consecutive days. However, according to the UPL, “if conflict with near peer adversary were to kick off today, only 15 days of support would be immediately available to support these platforms in a contested environment.” \nThe Space Force unfunded priorities list, on the other hand, looks to procure two additional launches in 2023 to accelerate initial launch capability of the mission warning/mission tracking layer to fiscal 2025.\nThe new service’s weapons system sustainment request would go toward improving missile warning and defense, space domain awareness, integrated tactical warning/attach assessment, launch range, military satellite communications, satellite control network, global positioning system, and space-based infrared systems shortfalls.\n“The Department of the Air Force has been underfunded for nearly three decades, delaying modernization and leading to a perpetually shrinking force that is now too small to meet the nation’s expectations,” Wright said. “Congress should not only approve every single unfunded priority on the Air Force and Space force lists, it should go one better and increase those investments.”\n", "中文原文": "2022年4月8日ByAmy Hudson空军没有资金的优先事项清单--它想要但无法挤进2023年财政预算请求的东西--将由国会来增加F-35战斗机的购买，这是如果它还有46亿美元可花的话，它将购买的东西清单的一部分。空军在2023年预算提案中只要求国会提供33架F-35，比2022年购买的减少15架，比2021年减少27架。美国空军表示，他们更愿意将这笔钱花在其他需要的现代化项目上，并等到Block 4版本的喷气式飞机准备就绪。没有资金的优先事项清单似乎略微缩小了这一差距，要求9.21亿美元再购买7架攻击战斗机，使该服务2023年的购买总额达到40架F-35，仍比2022年减少8架。UPL由空军杂志获得，但没有由国防部发布，它在上个月发布的2023年预算请求中列出了该服务想要但负担不起的八个优先事项。F-35在名单上排名第五。空天军协会主席退役中将·布鲁斯·赖特（Bruce Wright）表示：“空军没有资金的名单将只增加7架F-35飞机，不到过去三年每年要求的48架所需数量的一半。”“事实上，在2020年和2021年，国会将空军的请求从48项增加到60项，我们将敦促立法者在2023年也这样做。”在2022财年，空军要求再增加十几架F-15EX，作为当年42亿美元无资金优先事项清单的一部分，但它没有要求任何额外的F-35A攻击战斗机--这与前几年不同。太空部队向国会提供了自己的600万美元无资金优先事项清单。超过一半的请求（3.27亿美元）将用于机密项目，而其余的将在更具弹性的导弹预警和导弹跟踪（2亿美元）和武器系统维持（1.12亿美元）之间分配。武器系统维持是空军没有资金的第一优先事项。该部门要求5.79亿美元，并表示将支持其“最高优先级”仓库项目，包括B-52、F-16、T-38、C-17、战斗管理系统、C-5和分布式公共地面系统。被列为第二高愿望--尽管在财务上是最大的要求--是要求9.785亿美元购买另外4架370亿罗盘呼叫电子战飞机，这将使机队总数达到10架。按优先顺序列出的其他请求包括：3.97亿美元用于维修、更换或恢复“因维持不足、年龄过大、自然灾害、火灾、事故或其他原因损坏的设施，或改变或更换设施以实施新的或更高的标准，容纳新的功能，或更换通常持续50年以上的建筑构件。”UPL没有列出具体地点。2.76亿美元用于额外的小直径炸弹IIs，该部门表示，这种炸弹面临制造来源减少和武器采购材料短缺的问题。对峙弹药，如空军2023年预算请求中的AGM-158联合空对地对峙导弹系列tookpriority，该预算要求购买550个增程JASSM和28个远程反舰导弹变体。与此同时，2023年的预算请求要求采购761枚SDB II炸弹，也称为风暴破碎机，低于2022年的985枚。F-35要求的9.21亿美元将恢复从尚未授予的第17批中减去的一些飞机，这些飞机将具有第4块能力。预算发布后，美国空军负责计划和项目的副参谋长大卫·纳霍姆中将在接受《空军杂志》采访时说，如果资源允许，空军将购买更多的F-35，但鉴于第4号区块的延迟，空军选择加快F-15EX的购买，同时也腾出一些钱来帮助支付数十亿美元的核现代化账单。7.49亿美元用于全球至少26个军事建设项目，从新的儿童发展中心到模拟器，再到军事工作狗窝。该请求的最大一部分（2.86亿美元）将用于资助佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地、内布拉斯加州奥弗特空军基地和弗吉尼亚州兰利-尤斯蒂斯联合基地正在进行的自然灾害恢复另一大笔资金，1.14亿美元，将用于资助俄克拉荷马州廷克空军基地仓库腐蚀控制机库的KC-46A海湾1.97亿美元用于B-52，F-15，F-16和两个地点的“加油机”的高超音速测试，增加了承包商的能力，并吸收了安装工作量。具体地说，UPL要求5500万美元来实现“露天高超音速测试”，这“将高保真覆盖范围扩大到350海里以上的极端速度，允许更多更远距离和更长时间的拍摄”。根据该文件，这些资金还将有助于“弥合高超音速拦截、可重复使用车辆、促进滑翔和储存分离的能力差距”。5.16亿美元用于恢复就绪备件包，该服务称其“严重受损”", "中文源标题": "空军向国会提交46亿美元未获资助的优先事项清单；太空部队要求追加6亿美元", "英文整编": "The list of unfunded priorities of the US Air Force identifies eight priorities.

This low-energy protocol began appearing in high-end smartphones in 2019 but has not struck mainstream adoption until recently. UWB has found consolidated support from groups like the Car Connectivity Consortium (members include BMW, GM, Panasonic, Honda, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and others) and the FiRa Consortium (members include the likes of Apple, Bosch, NXP, Samsung, Qualcomm, Cisco, and Qorvo).\nWith the introduction of UWB technology in the iPhone 11, Apple ignited interest and investment in the UWB industry. \nAround this same time, a group of silicon valley veterans joined forces to create Mauna Kea Semiconductor (MKSemi): a semiconductor company focused on developing ultra-low-power UWB technology. Today, the company made headlines when it announced a recent funding round amounting to ~13M USD. In the same announcement, MKSemi also introduced its new UWB SoC.\nAll About Circuits sat down with Yifeng Zhang, CEO at MKSemi, and Thomas Chen, CMO at MKSemi, to hear about the company’s newest chip—which is acclaimed as the “world’s lowest power, highest-integrated chip solution” for coin cell battery-powered IoT.\nUWB Technology for Range Measurement \nUWB has recently been integrated into consumer electronics as a form of range measurement. \n“The goal [of UWB] is high accuracy range measurement,” Zhang explains. “The trick to do this is to have extremely accurate timing: if you measure the roundtrip time of a radio signal and you can measure it accurately, you can get an accurate distance.” \nUWB is uniquely suited to do this since the ultra-wide bandwidth allows for the use of extremely-narrow pulse widths in time-of-flight measurements.\nZhang elaborates, saying, “Physics tells us that the wider the bandwidth, the narrower the pulse. If you have a narrow enough pulse, that gives you a fine enough resolution for timing. You can read the time accurately, then you can measure the distance accurately. That's the intuitive thinking for UWB.”\nThanks to this, and other properties of UWB, the technology offers many benefits over competitors like RFID, BLE, or Wi-FI. UWB combines high precision, low power consumption, and fast transmission speeds. It’s for these reasons that the technology has recently found use in applications like Apple’s AirTags, where the extremely high precision of UWB allows for the accurate detection of assets. \nMKSemi Unveils MK8000 UWB SoC\nToday, MKSemi unveils the release of its new, ultra-low-power UWB SoC.\nThe company says the new device, the MK8000, is a highly-integrated SoC that combines the UWB radio subsystem and the compute all on-chip, leaving only the antenna design up to the end-user. The MK8000 is based on a 62.4 MHz Arm Cortex-M0 core and includes a unique intelligent signal processor, which MKSemi claims to improve computation efficiency by ten times. \nMKSemi claims that the new product offers the lowest power consumption on the market by at least double. In addition to its extremely small size, MKSemi also says the device has the widest frequency band of its kind. Published specs reveal that the MK8000 consumes 43 mA at 3 V/RX, achieves data rates up to 54 Mbps, and operates in a frequency band of 3–9 GHz.\nSpeaking to the secret of maintaining this small area and extremely low power without sacrificing performance, Zhang tells us, “Our design principle is to put as many analog subsystems as possible into the digital domain, since the analog circuits are always the power-hungry parts.”\nThe device is also said to be the first to include integrated 4 RX with intrinsic 3-D location capability.\nA General-purpose UWB SoC for Contact-free Applications\nMKSemi has designed the device to be a general-purpose UWB SoC for a variety of unique applications, including ticket validation, asset tracking, tap-free mobile payments, and residential and automotive access control, among many others.\nAs but one example, at CES this week, MKSemi will be demonstrating a reference design that features Infineon's PSOC63 Bluetooth LE MCU and the MK8000—the latter of which includes UWB ranging capability.\nThis UWB can be used to determine the device's distance to a car, unlock the car upon approach, and turn on the engine when inside the car.\n", "中文原文": "超宽带(UWB)是一种用于短距离高带宽无线通信的无线电技术。这种低能耗协议于2019年开始出现在高端智能手机中，但直到最近才被主流采用。UWB得到了汽车连接联盟（成员包括宝马、通用、松下、本田、现代、大众等）和FiRa联盟（成员包括苹果、博世、恩智浦、三星、高通、思科和Qorvo等）等集团的统一支持。随着UWB技术在iPhone 11中的引入，苹果点燃了人们对UWB产业的兴趣和投资。大约在同一时间，一群硅谷资深人士联手创建了莫纳克亚半导体（MKSemi）：一家专注于开发超低功耗超宽带技术的半导体公司。今天，该公司宣布了最近一轮总额约1300万美元的融资，成为头条新闻。在同一公告中，MKSemi还介绍了其新的UWB SoC。与MKSemi首席执行官张易峰和CMO陈托马斯坐在一起，听取了该公司最新的芯片--该芯片被誉为“世界上最低功耗、最高集成度的硬币电池驱动物联网芯片解决方案”。超宽带测距技术UWB最近作为一种测距形式被集成到消费类电子产品中。“超宽带的目标是高精度的距离测量，”张解释道。“做到这一点的诀窍是拥有极其准确的计时：如果你测量一个无线电信号的往返时间，并且你可以准确地测量它，你就可以得到准确的距离。”UWB是唯一适合这样做，因为超宽带允许在飞行时间测量中使用极窄的脉冲宽度。张解释说：“物理学告诉我们，带宽越宽，脉冲越窄。如果你有一个足够窄的脉冲，这给你一个足够好的分辨率计时。你可以准确地读懂时间，然后你就可以准确地测量距离。这是超宽带的直觉思维。“多亏了这一点，以及UWB的其他特性，这项技术比RFID、BLE或Wi-FI等竞争对手提供了许多好处。超宽带结合了高精度、低功耗和快传输速度。正是由于这些原因，这项技术最近在苹果的AirTags等应用程序中得到了应用，在这些应用程序中，UWB的极高精度允许准确地检测资产。MKSemi发布MK8000超宽带SoC今天，MKSemi发布了新的超低功耗UWB SoC。该公司表示，新设备MK8000是一个高度集成的SoC，结合了超宽带无线电子系统和芯片上的计算，只剩下天线设计留给最终用户。MK8000基于62.4MHz ARM Cortex-M0内核，并包含独特的智能信号处理器，MKSemi声称该处理器可将计算效率提高十倍。MKSemi声称，新产品提供了市场上最低的功耗至少两倍。除了体积极小之外，MKSemi还表示，该设备拥有同类设备中最宽的频带。公布的规格显示，MK8000在3 V/RX下消耗43毫安，实现高达54 Mbps的数据速率，并在3-9 GHz的频带内工作。谈到在不牺牲性能的情况下保持小面积和极低功耗的秘诀，张告诉我们：“我们的设计原则是将尽可能多的模拟子系统放在数字域中，因为模拟电路总是耗电的部分。”该设备也被认为是第一个包括集成4 RX与固有的3-D定位能力。一种适用于无接触应用的通用超宽带SoCMKSemi将该设备设计成一种通用UWB SoC，用于各种独特的应用，包括票证验证、资产跟踪、免抽头移动支付、住宅和汽车门禁等。仅举一个例子，在本周的CES上，MKSemi将展示一个参考设计，该设计采用英飞凌的PSOC63蓝牙LE MCU和MK8000--后者包括UWB测距能力。这种超宽带可以用来确定设备到汽车的距离，在接近时解锁汽车，并在车内打开发动机。", "中文源标题": "低功耗、高集成度：MKSemi推出新型UWB SoC", "英文整编": "Recently, MKSemi Company of Mauna Kea released MK8000 ultra-wideband system on a chip.

(Sgt. Thiem Huynh/Army)\nProject Convergence began in 2020 at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, as a way for the Army to evaluate the progress of its modernization efforts. The following year, the event became joint as the services attempted to connect sensors and shooters for a combined capability to detect, track and defeat threats on the battlefield.\nThe latest iteration, held during fall 2022, increased the experimentation scope and scale and added the land armies of the United Kingdom and Australia in an effort to improve data sharing.\nThose coalition partners from PC 22 plan to participate with their own joint forces in addition to their armies this time around, according to Lt. Gen. Scott McKean, who is also director of the Army’s Futures and Concepts Center.\nHe said in a Feb. 3 interview the service is extending the time between capstone events to give the joint force time to validate observations made in PC 22, which took place in late October and early November, and prepare for more complex integration between the U.S. and the participating international partners.\n“Based off our learning here in PC 22, we’re going to take the things that we believe are ready, or things that we saw out at PC, and we’re going to apply them in upcoming exercises,” McKean said. Doing so, he added, will help ensure the findings at Project Convergence hold up in operational environments.\n“The closest thing we have to war are exercises,” he said.\nAs one example, the force took sense-and-shoot capabilities demonstrated at Project Convergence to a live-fire test White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, “we had the right instrumentation to make sure that what we saw wasn’t some fabrication or due to workarounds,” McKean said.\nIf technology that succeeded at Project Convergence doesn’t at exercises, the military can take it back into experimentation, according to McKean. If it does perform at an exercise, “that becomes part of the theater’s capabilities,” he added.\nThe next Project Convergence will focus on experimentation at the theater level, beyond the tactical level addressed previously, according to McKean, which will include tackling more challenging threats.\nPart of the upcoming evaluation will examine if the joint force is getting closer to achieving what it calls a “kill web,” which evolves the “kill chain” that follows a linear process of sensing threats and shooting a target and expands that into a comprehensive network of sensors from space all the way to the ground and connects those sensors to a network of options to take out threat targets on the battlefield.\n“We’ve always aspired to get this kill web type of capability as a joint and combined force, and we’re starting to get to that point,” McKean said. “We’re not there completely yet, but we’re definitely making great strides toward it.”\nMcKean stressed Project Convergence is no longer just an Army event, even though it is led by the service. The effort, he said, has become increasingly joint.\nThe “big assessment” will come at the joint staff level, McKean said. “Is this something that we need services to continue to kind of have to generate or is this something that a joint directive will start taking more involvement in?

The \"Convergence Project\" combat experiment held in the autumn of 2022 expanded the scope and scale of the experiment, and added the British and Australian Army to improve the data sharing capability.In order to give the joint forces time to verify the results of the \"Convergence Project 2022\" combat experiment and prepare for more complex integration between the United States and international partners, the US Army will extend the time interval of the next round of \"Convergence Project\" combat experiment. For example, the U.S. Army will apply the perception-shooting capability demonstrated by \"Convergence Project 2022\" to the live-fire test of White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. If the successful technology demonstrated in \"Convergence Project\" does not work in the live-fire test, the military can reuse it in the experiment. If it really achieves the established capability, it will become a part of the battlefield capability.The \"Convergence Project\" in 2024 will expand the focus from tactical level to theater level, and the participants will include the joint forces of allies to deal with more challenging threats. The event will partly examine whether the joint forces are close to realizing the \"kill network\", which has developed the \"kill chain\" and expanded it into an integrated sensor network from space to the ground to eliminate threat targets on the battlefield. The \"Convergence Project\" is no longer just an Army activity, but is becoming a joint activity led by the US Army with multi-service and multi-country participation."}, {"中文标题": "美国防部高层：需加大投资应对中国挑战", "情报来源": "美国海军研究学会网站", "时间": "2022年11月7日", "整编内容": "11月4日，美国防部负责政策事务的副部长科林·卡尔在布鲁金斯学会发言称，中国大陆在未来两年内不可能“攻击”台湾，但将加大对台施压。美国必须投资多项能力（包括水下能力、态势感知能力等），以打破中国反介入/区域拒止防御；在太平洋地区作战时，需考虑海军陆战队和陆军的不同优势；加强综合威慑，关注针对\"灰色地带活动\"的信息战；开发网络工具，并不断与对手“接触”。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "军事科学院军事科学信息研究中心", "源网址": "https://news.usni.org/2022/11/07/china-will-increase-pressure-on-taiwan-in-next-two-years-rather-than-invade-says-pentagon-official", "源标题": "China Will Increase Pressure on Taiwan in Next Two Years Rather Than Invade, Says Pentagon Official", "原文": "By:John Grady\nNovember 7, 2022 2:39 PM\nThe Pentagon’s top civilian for policy does not think China is likely to attack Taiwan in the next two years, although he expects Beijing to ratchet up pressure on Tapei as Xi Jinping continues to expand his military’s capabilities for a possible amphibious invasion.\nThe Chinese response to House Speak Nancy Pelosi’s August visit to the island served as a “test drive” for what an invasion or blockade might look like, Colin Kahl said.To express their anger over her visit, the Chinese began wide-ranging live fire exercises, deployed its two aircraft carriers, an amphibious assault ship and accompanying warships close to the island and repeatedly sent military aircraft across the Taiwan Strait,reported USNI News. They also test-fired a variety of missiles around the island.\nSpeaking at the Brookings Institution Friday,Kahl said China also ratcheted up pressure to “establish a sphere of influence” by flying military aircraft dangerously close to Americanaircraft and allies operating in international airspace to clear the way for any future military action near Taiwan and the Western Pacific.\nThePeoples Liberation Army Air Force’s “come up and say hello” activity is provocativeand could lead to a military incident, Kahl said.\nChinese aircraft this spring released chaff and flares at an Australian maritime surveillance P-8, then cut across its flight path and stayed there for a time, he said. Some of the debris entered at least one of the P-8’s engines.\n“This is a challenge that will continue to grow in the future,” he said.\nKahl said the United States must make the investments “to show we can break through the bubble” of Chinese Anti-Access/Area Denial defenses. Those investments include undersea capabilities where the United States already has a technological advantage.\nThe U.S. also needs to“think differently about the capabilities of the Marines and the Army”when operating in the Pacific,Kahl said. He added both services are doing so and exercising in new ways together and with allies.\nThat investment includesthinking about current posture, now heavily concentrated toward Northeast Asia, and how best to work with allies like Australia and the United Kingdom through the agreement to share the technology Canberra needs to build and sustain nuclear attack submarines, as well aswith the Quad, the informal security and economic development arrangement with Australia, Japan and India.\n“We’ve had multi-carrier exercises [with the United Kingdom] off the coast of the Philippines” and have extended Republic of Korea and U.S. air exercises in the wake of more missile test-firings by Pyongyang, he said.\nKahl added these activities all fit in the Biden administration’s “admonishment to ourselves” on the value of integrated deterrence — the White House term for a whole of government response to China.There “has to be a daily effort to shape our adversary’s perception” of what the United States and its allies are capable of doing in a crisis. Some of that comes by what is revealedin exercises and announcements of tests, he added\nInformation operations against “gray zone activities” also has value, as the United States showed when it publicly warned of the Russian build-up to invade Ukraine by sharing intelligence publiclyor most recently citing intelligence thatIran was planning to attack Saudi Arabia.\nThe idea behind these releases is both “shining a light” on what is happening behind an adversary’s closed doors and “throwing a lot of sand in the gears” causing an adversary to back off, Kahl said. In the case of Ukraine, it led to a unity of the NATO and European Union responses to the invasion by supplying Ukraine with arms and ammunition, intelligence and advanced systems and humanitarian aid. That unity extended to increasingly severe economic sanctions on Russian business, financial institutions and individuals.\nIn cyber, Kahl said the approach is different.\n“Develop the tools and constantly be in contact with the adversary” so they know you are a presence,” he said.\n“We have been [the Chinese] pacing challenge for years,” Kahl said drawing on language from the recently released National Defense Strategy. “The gap has closed,” but “no one should doubt the United States” retains the most capable military force.\nThe “PRC [People’s Republic of China] challenge is more global” in the long-term than that posed by Russia, although both are nuclear powers, Kahl said. The “acute” challenge, the strategy’s term for Moscow, is both “immediate and sharp” but more regional – in nations that made up the former Soviet Union and along NATO’s eastern border.\nIn the case of “opportunistic aggression” by one either Russia or China, if the United States is already engaged in a major theater conflict with the other, Kahl said, “we believe we can walk and chew gum at the same time.”\nHe added Washington’s global network of allies and partners “are a hedge against a two-war scenario.”\n", "中文原文": "作者：约翰·格雷迪2022年11月7日下午2:39五角大楼负责政策的最高文职人员认为，中国不太可能在未来两年攻击台湾，尽管他预计，随着习近平继续扩大其军队可能的两栖入侵能力，北京方面将加大对塔培的压力。科林·卡尔说，中国对众议院议长南希·佩洛西8月份访问该岛的回应是对入侵或封锁可能是什么样子的“试驾”。据USNI新闻报道，为了表达他们对她访问的愤怒，中国开始了大范围的实弹演习，在该岛附近部署了两艘航空母舰、一艘两栖攻击舰和随行军舰，并多次派遣军用飞机穿越台湾海峡。他们还在岛上试射了各种导弹。卡尔星期五在布鲁金斯学会（Brookings Institution）发表讲话时说，中国还加大了压力，要求“建立势力范围”，让军用飞机危险地靠近在国际空域活动的美国飞机和盟友，为未来在台湾和西太平洋附近的任何军事行动扫清道路。卡尔说，中国人民解放军空军的“上来打招呼”活动是挑衅，可能会导致军事事件。他说，今年春天，中国飞机向一架澳大利亚海上监视P-8飞机释放了箔条和照明弹，然后切断了它的飞行路线，并在那里停留了一段时间。一些碎片至少进入了P-8的一个发动机。“这是一个未来将继续增长的挑战，”他说。卡尔说，美国必须进行投资，“以表明我们能够突破”中国反准入/区域拒绝防御的泡沫。这些投资包括美国已经拥有技术优势的海底能力。卡尔说，美国在太平洋行动时还需要“对海军陆战队和陆军的能力进行不同的思考”。他补充说，两个部门都在这样做，并与盟友一起以新的方式进行锻炼。这种投资包括考虑目前的姿态，现在主要集中在东北亚，以及如何最好地与澳大利亚和英国等盟友合作，通过分享堪培拉建造和维持攻击核潜艇所需的技术的协议，以及四方，即与澳大利亚、日本和印度的非正式安全和经济发展安排。他说：“我们（与英国）在菲律宾海岸举行了多航母演习”，并在平壤进行更多导弹试射后，延长了韩国和美国的空中演习。卡尔补充说，这些活动都符合拜登政府对综合威慑价值的“告诫”--这是白宫对政府对中国的整个反应的术语。“必须每天努力塑造我们的对手对美国及其盟友在危机中能够做什么的看法”。他补充说，其中一些来自演习和测试公告中揭示的内容打击“灰色地带活动”的信息行动也有价值，正如美国公开警告俄罗斯准备入侵乌克兰时所表明的那样，美国公开分享情报，或者最近援引塔蒂兰计划攻击沙特阿拉伯的情报。卡尔说，这些发布背后的想法既是“照亮”对手关闭的大门后发生的事情，也是“在齿轮上扔了很多沙子”，导致对手退缩。就乌克兰而言，通过向乌克兰提供武器弹药、情报和先进系统以及人道主义援助，北约和欧洲联盟统一了对入侵的反应。这种团结延伸到对俄罗斯商业、金融机构和个人越来越严厉的经济制裁。在网络方面，卡尔说方法是不同的。“开发工具，不断与对手接触”，这样他们就知道你是一个存在，“他说。“多年来，我们一直是（中国）步调一致的挑战，”卡尔援引最近发布的国防战略中的措辞表示。“差距已经缩小”，但“没有人应该怀疑美国”保留了最有能力的军事力量。卡尔说，从长远来看，“中华人民共和国的挑战比俄罗斯提出的挑战更具全球性”，尽管两国都是核大国。该战略对莫斯科的术语是“尖锐”挑战，既“紧迫又尖锐”，但更多的是地区性挑战--在前苏联和北约东部边境的国家。卡尔说，在俄罗斯或中国一方的“机会主义侵略”的情况下，如果美国已经与另一方发生了重大的战区冲突，“我们相信我们可以一边走路一边嚼口香糖。”他补充说，华盛顿的全球盟友和伙伴网络“是对两场战争场景的对冲。”", "中文源标题": "五角大楼官员表示，未来两年，中国将加大对台湾的压力，而不是入侵", "英文整编": "On November 4th, Colin Carr, deputy secretary for policy affairs of the US Department of Defense, spoke at the Brookings Institution, saying that Chinese mainland could not \"attack\" Taiwan Province in the next two years, but would increase pressure on Taiwan Province.

Gen. Jeth Rey said during a presentation at the Army’s Technical Exchange Meeting here on Dec. 2 that the first takeaway was the need for a data fabric, which links disparate systems and technologies for a more seamless flow of information.\n“There was no way that we could have achieved what we did at PC 21 with sensor to shooter without having a data fabric,” Rey said. “That’s why I told the team we have to push to get a data fabric earlier rather than later. I also explained that is also going to achieve” Joint All-Domain Command and Control.\nSecond, Rey said this year’s event saw a significant improvement in coverage from resilient wide-band satellite communications. The main difference this year was bandwidth virtualization through aggregated high capacity/low latency communications.\nThe experiment leveraged LEO and MEO capabilities while combining military and commercial SATCOM to move data on the battlefield.\nWhile the bandwidth virtualization is at a low technology readiness level, Rey said the Army’s research and development community is working hard to mature it faster.\nHe said these SATCOM capabilities should be described as resilient rather than protected.\n“I just didn’t want senior leadership to think that you put up a protected SATCOM and nothing was going to happen to it as far as jamming or any other capability that adversaries may have out there,” he said, adding that it is resilient.\nThese SATCOM technologies and concepts will greatly improve the Army’s communications options — what it refers to as its PACE plan, or primary, alternate, contingency and emergency — and help get the service to what leaders have described as a transport agnostic environment, Rey said.\nThe third lesson Rey gathered from Project Convergence is the importance of an aerial tier to the network to improve the resiliency and range.\n“We did not realize how important it was to have an aerial tier overhead loitering for more than 20 to 26 hours and providing an extension of our network,” he said.\nGoing forward, he said he wants the Army to expand this capability to loiter to reach more than 48 hours. Rey noted this loitering capability would be undetected while in flight.\nAdditionally, Rey said they identified the need to help the Future Vertical Lift team achieve greater low probability of intercept/low probability of detection capability, from an aerial tier perspective.\nThe fourth key at Project Convergence for Rey was the way the edge mesh networking was extended at the experiment.\nWhile Project Convergence was mainly focused at brigades and below, the Army is transitioning to a paradigm in which the division will be the primary unit of action. This means there will need to be greater capabilities above the brigade level.\nDespite being focused on the brigade, when a variety of sensors and autonomous systems were introduced from the division, they stretched the network more than they expected, Rey said.\n“At the same time, having the division not able to see everything that was happening from the BCT and below level, made us realize the division needs to have some level of capability when it comes to the [integrated tactical network],” he said.\nNow, the Army is reevaluating how it can outfit the division with capabilities to support the integrated tactical network.\nThe fifth takeaway from Project Convergence was the need for a joint common operational picture. This year’s event included all of the services for the first time.\nThe Army has been building the Command Post Computing Environment, a web-enabled system that will consolidate current mission systems and programs into a single-user interface.\nDuring Project Convergence, Rey said they were able to bring the Navy and Marine Corps into CPCE to provide a joint common operational picture.\n", "中文原文": "田纳西州纳什维尔。-陆军今年秋天在尤马试验场进行的融合21项目实验为军种网络跨职能小组主任提供了五个主要教训，从数据结构的重要性到联合作战共同画面的必要性，以指导未来的工作。12月2日，杰斯·雷伊准将在陆军技术交流会上的一次演讲中说，第一个要点是需要一个数据结构，该结构将不同的系统和技术联系起来，以实现更无缝的信息流动。雷伊说：“如果没有数据结构，我们不可能在PC 21上实现传感器到射手的目标。”“这就是为什么我告诉团队，我们必须尽早而不是推迟获得数据结构。我还解释说，还将实现“全域联合指挥和控制”。第二，雷伊说，今年的活动看到了弹性宽带卫星通信在覆盖方面的显著改善。今年的主要区别是通过聚合高容量/低延迟通信实现带宽虚拟化。这项实验利用了低轨和中轨的能力，同时将军用和商用卫星通信结合起来，在战场上传输数据。虽然带宽虚拟化处于低技术准备水平，但雷伊说，陆军的研发社区正在努力使其更快成熟。他说，这些卫星通信功能应该被描述为弹性，而不是受保护。“我只是不想让高级领导层认为，你安装了一个受保护的卫星通信系统，就干扰或对手可能拥有的任何其他能力而言，它不会发生任何事情，”他说，并补充说，它是弹性的。雷伊说，这些卫星通信技术和概念将极大地改善陆军的通信选择--它所说的速度计划，或主要、备用、应急和紧急情况--并有助于将服务带到领导人所说的运输不可知论环境。Rey从Project Congression中得到的第三个教训是，在网络中建立空中层以提高弹性和范围的重要性。“我们没有意识到有一个空中层在头顶上游荡超过20到26个小时并提供我们网络的延伸有多重要，”他说。展望未来，他说，他希望军队扩大这种游荡能力，使其达到48小时以上。雷伊指出，这种游荡能力在飞行中不会被发现。此外，雷伊说，他们认为有必要从航空层的角度帮助未来的垂直升降机团队实现更大的低拦截概率/低探测概率能力。Rey项目收敛的第四个关键是在实验中扩展边缘网格网络的方式。虽然项目融合主要集中在旅及以下，但陆军正在向师将成为主要行动单位的范式过渡。这意味着旅级以上需要更大的能力。雷伊说，尽管专注于该旅，但当从该师引进各种传感器和自主系统时，它们比他们预期的要扩大网络。“与此同时，该部门无法看到BCT及其以下级别发生的一切，这让我们意识到，在（综合战术网络）方面，该部门需要有一定水平的能力，”他说。现在，陆军正在重新评估如何为该师配备支持综合战术网络的能力。项目融合的第五个收获是需要一个联合的共同运作画面。今年的活动首次包括所有服务。陆军一直在建立指挥所计算环境，这是一个网络支持的系统，将把当前的任务系统和程序合并到一个单一用户界面中。在融合项目中，雷伊说，他们能够将海军和海军陆战队纳入CPCE，以提供一个联合的共同作战画面。", "中文源标题": "陆军在融合项目21中了解到的关于其网络的五件事", "英文整编": "Jess, director of the cross-functional team of the US Army?

In the future, the Army should improve the air layer network capability to more than 48 hours to help the \"Future Vertical Lift\" program team have greater low probability interception/detection capabilities; The fourth is to expand the edge mesh network. The US Army is turning to the division as the main combat unit, and is currently reassessing how to provide comprehensive tactical network capabilities for division-level troops; Fifth, to understand the importance of joint operations picture, the US Army is building a command post computing environment, which can integrate the current mission systems and programs into a single user interface to provide joint operations picture for various US military services."}, {"中文标题": "韩国LiG-Nex1公司使用AESA雷达为军舰开发近程武器系统", "情报来源": "印度防务世界网站", "时间": "2021年7月26日", "整编内容": "韩国LiG-Nex1公司正在开发CIWS-II近程武器系统，该系统将采用KF-21战斗机配备的有源相控阵（AESA）雷达系统。\nCIWS-II在国防采办项目管理局（DAPA）项目下开发，投资 200亿韩元（2.777亿美元），预计2030年之前完成。CIWS-II是一种点防御武器系统，用于探测和摧毁突破外层防御的短程导弹和敌机，通常安装在舰艇上。据韩媒报道，现有的韩国海军舰艇上的CIWS系统采购自外国制造商泰雷兹公司，采用的是机械雷达。\n（中国航发研究院 刘翠玉）", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中国航空发动机研究院", "源网址": "https://www.defenseworld.net/news/30102/LiG_Nex1_Developing_Close_in_Weapons_System_with_AESA_Radar_for_Warships", "源标题": "LiG-Nex1 Developing Close-in Weapons System with AESA Radar for Warships", "原文": "South Korean LiG-Nex1 is developing close-in weapons system （CIWS-II） whose AESA radar system will be derived from that of the KF-21 jet.\nThe CIWS-II is being developed under a Defense Acquisition Program Administration （DAPA） project investing20 billion won （$277.7 million） to complete the project by 2030.\nCIWS-II is a point-defense weapon system for detecting and destroying short-range missiles and enemy aircraft that penetrate outer defenses.

An international team is addressing that need by developing a promising process to develop high-quality 2D materials that could power next-generation electronics.\nSang-Hoon Bae, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, is one of three researchers leading the multi-institutional work published Jan. 18 in Nature, together with his doctoral student Justin S. Kim and postdoctoral research associate Yuan Meng.\nThe work, which includes two technical breakthroughs, is the first to report that their method to grow semiconductor materials, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), would make devices faster and use less power.\nThe team, co-led by Jeehwan Kim, an associate professor of mechanical engineering and of materials science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Jin-Hong Park, a professor of information and communication engineering and of electronic and electrical engineering at Sungkyunkwan University, had to overcome three extremely difficult challenges to create the new materials: securing single crystallinity at wafer-scale; preventing irregular thickness during growth at wafer-scale; and vertical heterostructures at wafer-scale.\nBae said 3D materials go through a process of roughening and smoothing to become an even-surfaced material. However, 2D materials don't allow this process, resulting in an uneven surface that makes it difficult to have a large-scale, high-quality, uniform 2D material.\n\"We designed a geometric-confined structure that facilitates kinetic control of 2D materials so that all grand challenges in high-quality 2D material growth are resolved,\" Bae said. \"Thanks to the facilitated kinetic control, we only needed to grow self-defined seeding for a shorter growing time.\"\nThe team made another technical breakthrough by demonstrating single-domain heterojunction TMDs at the wafer scale, or a large scale, by layer-by-layer growth. To confine the growth of the nuclei, they used various substrates made from chemical compounds. These substrates formed a physical barrier that prevented lateral-epitaxy formation and forced vertical growth.\n\"We believe that our confined growth technique can bring all the great findings in physics of 2D materials to the level of commercialization by allowing the construction of single domain layer-by-layer heterojunctions at the wafer-scale,\" Bae said.\nBae said other researchers are studying this material at very small sizes of tens to hundreds of micrometers.\n\"We scaled up because we can solve the issue by producing the high-quality material at large scale,\" Bae said. \"Our achievement will lay a strong foundation for 2D materials to fit into industrial settings.\"\n", "中文原文": "研究人员一直在寻找用提供更高性能和更低功耗同时具有可扩展性的材料来取代电子产品中的硅。一个国际团队正在通过开发一种有希望的方法来开发高质量的二维材料，可以为下一代电子产品提供动力，从而满足这一需求。圣路易斯华盛顿大学麦凯维工程学院机械工程和材料科学助理教授相勋·裴（Sang-Hoon Bae）与他的博士生贾斯汀·金（Justin S.Kim）和博士后研究员袁梦（Yun Meng）一起，是领导1月18日发表在《自然》杂志上的多机构工作的三名研究人员之一。这项工作包括两项技术突破，首次报告了他们生长半导体材料的方法，即过渡金属二卤化物(TMD)，将使器件更快，耗电更少。该团队由麻省理工学院机械工程和材料科学与工程副教授Jeehwan Kim和成均馆大学信息与通信工程和电子与电气工程教授Jin-Hong Park共同领导，必须克服三个极其困难的挑战来创造新材料：确保晶圆规模的单晶性；防止晶片尺度生长过程中的不规则厚度；和晶片尺度的垂直异质结构。Bae公司表示，3D材料经过粗糙和平滑的过程，成为表面均匀的材料。然而，二维材料不允许这种过程，导致表面不均匀，这使得很难有一个大规模的，高质量的，均匀的二维材料。Bae说：“我们设计了一种几何约束结构，便于二维材料的动力学控制，从而解决了高质量二维材料生长中的所有重大挑战。”“多亏了方便的动力学控制，我们只需要在更短的生长时间内种植自定义的种子。”该团队通过逐层生长，在晶圆规模或大规模演示单畴异质结TMDs取得了另一项技术突破。为了限制细胞核的生长，他们使用了各种由化合物制成的基底。这些衬底形成了一个物理屏障，阻止了侧向外延的形成，并迫使垂直生长。Bae说：“我们相信，我们的受限生长技术可以通过在晶圆规模上构建单畴逐层异质结，将二维材料物理学中所有伟大的发现带到商业化的水平。”Bae说，其他研究人员正在几十到几百微米的非常小的尺寸上研究这种材料。“我们扩大规模是因为我们可以通过大规模生产高质量的材料来解决这个问题，”Bae说。“我们的成果将为二维材料适应工业环境奠定坚实的基础。”", "中文源标题": "两大技术突破让高品质二维材料成为可能", "英文整编": "Recently, Washington University in St. Louis has developed high-quality two-dimensional materials that can accelerate the development of the next generation of electronic products.

The DEM, an Office of the Secretary of Defense-funded Joint Capability Technology Demonstration, aims to mature, demonstrate and transition technologies that enable a weapon’s effects to be tailored dynamically in flight. This new capability will give the Department of the Air Force the ability to prosecute targets more effectively in high-end fights, which equates to greater mission flexibility. During the mission, an F-16 from the 96th Test Wing released a single DEM onto the target area. Prior to the weapon’s release, the pilot programmed the DEM to conduct a precise lethal footprint attack from the cockpit. The precise lethal footprint attack focuses the weapons effects to a limited area where collateral damage could be a concern. Ultimately, the DEM achieved the mission as planned with evidence of its effectiveness visible throughout the target area.", "原文": "An earlier successful mission demonstrated the DEM’s ability to conduct a wide area attack mission, which delivers effects across a large target area. Additionally, a sled test was conducted to confirm the weapon’s perforation capability in late 2020. “The new innovative technologies developed from this effort will give our aircrews increased capability to control the desired effects of weapon systems,” said Gerald Tighe, Oversight Executive Deputy Director, JCTD Programs, at OSD. “Through the DEM JCTD’s proven cockpit selectable (Dialable) effects technology the warfighter will be able strategically carry out the mission more effectively.” The DEM is a 2,000-pound munition containing a number of AFRL Munitions Directorate technologies as well as contributions from the Army Combat Capabilities Development Command and contractor partners including Faxon Machining and L3 Harris. DEM technologies include a pre-formed fragment warhead case, an electronic safe and arm device, distributed embedded firesets, and a precision height-of-burst sensor. These technologies control the weapon’s lethal footprint, fragment speed and direction, while a Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kit guides the munition to the target. In effect, the pilot can select munition effects based on three critical mission areas: An Area Attack effect that detonates high above the target for maximum dispersed effects over the area where collateral damage is not an issue; A Precise Lethal Footprint effect that detonates lower over the target to confine effects to a small area for low-collateral damage; and a Surface Target Perforation effect that detonates after the weapon punches through a structure.\nThe success of the DEM’s first live flight test was bolstered by AFRL’s partnership with OSD and United States Central Command. Although DEM continues testing, its fuzing, explosives, warhead, and sensors have transitioned to several weapons programs, where they are already increasing effectiveness and survivability. While the technology is useful in weapons of many sizes, a large form factor will give the Department of the Air Force a unitary weapon that performs as well or better than current cluster munitions; albeit, without the concerns of unexploded ordnance or UXO. With the success of this test, aircrews will be able to modify munitions effects to accommodate dynamic target tasking in-flight, enabling a capability that greatly influences the success of pilots and aircrews in diverse and dynamic battlefields. Additionally, having a weapon that can fill the role of three or more different weapons streamlines the logistics footprint, which has positive implications for costs, storage and time. “I’m really excited to see the team tackling tough problems like dialable effects, so our warfighters have options for weapons that respond to their needs, as conditions change in the heat of battle,” saidMaj. Gen. Heather Pringle, AFRL commander. “In addition, the technology has the potential to simplify the sizes and types of weapons needed at the forward edge of the battlefield, which leads to a more efficient, less costly support tail.” Future work will focus on continuing the transition of technologies from DEM to current weapon programs and miniaturizing the technology to increase weapon load out and aircraft platform availability. “We must ensure our weapon systems can adapt to changing operational conditions faster than our adversary can react,” said Joe Letsinger, Senior Scientific Technical Manager at AFRL’s Munitions Directorate. “The technologies we are pursuing for DEM, specifically for adaptive warheads, gives us the ability to effectively prosecute a wider range of targets from a single weapon.

Prompt repairs of these issues prevents engine failures and saves expensive assets. Yet each maintenance action increases costs. The DOD prioritizes maintenance expenditure reduction by its increasing use of condition-based maintenance (CBM+). To enhance materiel availability at the lowest possible cost, CBM+ minimizes unscheduled repairs, eliminates unnecessary maintenance activity, and employs the most cost-effective maintenance management techniques.1CBM+ produces a holistic view of equipment conditions in part by conducting non-destructive inspections (NDI).\nA CTMA project—Rapid and Agile 3D Scanner with Micron Accuracy for Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI)—has developed an affordable NDI system to decrease maintenance cycle time and costs for jet engine blades while increasing inspection accuracy. This initiative brought together the US Army (Letterkenny Army Depot), Navy (Fleet Readiness Center East), and Air Force (Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center), along with industry partners MDS Coating Technologies and Automated Precision, Inc. (API). Completed in 2018, the project has created an affordable, optical, one-cell NDI system for turbine rotor compressor blades. A one-cell system is defined as a single maneuverable platform that mounts the sample blade and enables optical sensors to provide inspections. This one-cell solution enables automation of sequential inspection processes seamlessly, where critical parameters are documented and shared as the system progresses through the processes.\nThe one-cell NDI system acquires precision dimensional data of blade profiles using API’s commercial 3D laser scanning technology, RapidScan. During inspection, three optical sensors are employed to provide three novel measurement techniques: 1) shadow imaging for cavity detection, 2) a laser line scanner for geometry, and 3) a time-to-spectrum mapping interferometer (TSMI) scanner for high-resolution scanning of blade edges and blade surface cavities. The instruments are integrated and aligned in a single sensor housing with the same standoff, which offers motorized rotary motion, motorized vertical motion, and semi-automated blade mounting. The platform applies the three sequential techniques, from the shadow imaging to the TSMI, seamlessly without readjustment of the blade sample’s location.\nWith the shadow imaging technique, the project team has created a new inspection process, “cavitation detection,” to identify the area of interest for blade surface inspection and locations of cavities with the most significant impairments. This technique combines a special lighting method with a high-resolution camera to emphasize shadows of cavities—it creates an image of the surface that highlights the contrast between a cavity and its coating boundary. The technology integrates a contrast-enhancing image processing and boundary detection algorithm into the hardware to enable real-time intelligent cavity detection. Users can apply a criterion to limit the number of most significant cavities to be scanned by the TSMI or simply to draw a go/no-go decision.\nThe line scanner has been designed to scan an area 50mm wide by 200mm high with a scanning resolution of 0.1mm. Based on the blade size information provided by the shadow imaging, the line scanning area is determined and scanned correctly without any readjustment of the blade sample’s position. The rotary stage allows the opposite surface to be scanned.\nWhile the geometry measurement requires large area scanning on an entire blade surface with medium resolution, the TSMI provides 10 times finer resolution (0.01mm) and better accuracy (0.001mm) with programmable scanning at 120,000 point-measurements-per-second. This high-resolution accurate scanner is suitable for scanning microscopic-resolution surface topology on any impaired surface with feature size ranging from 0.005mm to 100mm or longer, with very long standoff of up to 300mm.\nThe TSMI scanner is used for two inspections: the cavitation topology scan and the blade leading-edge scan. For the cavitation scan, based on the given list of cavity locations, the TSMI points to each cavity and performs programmed scanning on the cavity’s surface. During the CTMA project, the typical cavity size was 3mm x 3mm square, which meant it would take 30 seconds to scan 10 cavities widely distributed on the surface of the blade sample. A configurable criterion is applied to the scan results to determine whether blades are repairable. The leading-edge inspection consists of two measurements. One profiles the edge and compares it with a nominal edge profile for estimating the extent of wear and critical chips on the edge. The second profiles the cross-sectional curvature of the edge and compares that with the nominal curvature for estimating the extent and progress of the wear. During the project, this process achieved a measurement repeatability of better than 0.001 mm (2 sigma).\nAdditionally, this project has developed user interface software to provide visual guidance for the inspection process without interrupting operations. All determined parameters and go/no-go decisions are displayed to allow an interactive process and final review. The software enables technicians to produce final reports with data that can assist with trend analysis and process improvements.\nThis rapid and agile 3D scanner’s ability to attain sub-micron level accuracy ensures that blades are inspected correctly and provides quantitative analysis of erosion and cavitation. The system can improve DOD maintenance by preventing hundreds of thousands of reusable blades from being rejected each year and by correctly rejecting faulty ones. Due to its portability, the scanner can be deployed at maintenance depots and at first- and second-line maintenance shops. Moreover, the scanner can be used for many similar inspections, including wide-area scanning of wings and other structural sections of aircraft, helicopters, heavy machinery, and vehicles.\n", "中文原文": "·2022年4月13日维持喷气发动机叶片需要维修人员识别问题，包括几何磨损、表面质量差、前缘磨损、涂层磨损以及空腔的位置和大小。及时修复这些问题可以防止发动机故障并节省昂贵的资产。然而，每一个维护行动都会增加成本。国防部通过越来越多地使用基于状态的维修(CBM+)来优先减少维修支出。为了以尽可能低的成本提高材料的可用性，CBM+最大限度地减少计划外维修，消除不必要的维护活动，并采用最具成本效益的维护管理技术。1CBM+部分通过进行无损检查(NDI)来全面了解设备状况。CTMA的一个项目--用于无损检测的微米精度的快速敏捷三维扫描仪(NDI)--开发了一种负担得起的NDI系统，以减少喷气发动机叶片的维护周期时间和成本，同时提高检测精度。这项倡议汇集了美国陆军（莱特肯尼陆军仓库）、海军（舰队准备中心东部）和空军（俄克拉荷马城航空后勤中心），以及行业合作伙伴MDS涂层技术和自动化精密公司(API)。该项目于2018年完成，为涡轮转子压缩机叶片创建了一个负担得起的光学单单元NDI系统。单单元系统定义为安装样品叶片并使光学传感器能够提供检查的单个可操作平台。这种单单元解决方案实现了顺序检查过程的无缝自动化，关键参数被记录下来，并随着系统在整个过程中的进展而共享。单单元NDI系统使用API的商用三维激光扫描技术RapidScan获取叶片型面的精确尺寸数据。在检测过程中，采用三种光学传感器提供了三种新的测量技术：1）阴影成像用于腔体检测，2)激光线扫描仪用于几何形状检测，3)时间-光谱映射干涉仪用于叶片边缘和叶片表面腔体的高分辨率扫描。该仪器集成和对准在一个单一的传感器外壳与相同的支座，提供机动旋转运动，机动垂直运动，和半自动刀片安装。该平台无缝地应用了从阴影成像到TSMI的三种顺序技术，无需重新调整叶片样品的位置。利用阴影成像技术，项目组创建了一个新的检查过程，“空化检测”，以确定叶片表面检查的感兴趣区域和最严重损伤的空化位置。这种技术结合了一种特殊的照明方法和高分辨率相机来强调空洞的阴影--它创建了一个表面图像，突出了空洞和涂层边界之间的对比度。该技术将对比度增强图像处理和边界检测算法集成到硬件中，实现了实时智能空腔检测。用户可以应用一个标准来限制TSMI要扫描的最重要的腔的数量，或者简单地得出一个去/不去的决定。线扫描仪的设计可以扫描50mm宽、200mm高的区域，扫描分辨率为0.1mm。根据阴影成像提供的叶片尺寸信息，在不调整叶片样品位置的情况下，确定并正确扫描行扫描区域。旋转工作台允许扫描相对表面。虽然几何测量需要在整个叶片表面进行大面积的中等分辨率扫描，但TSMI提供了10倍的精细分辨率（0.01毫米）和更好的精度（0.001毫米），可编程扫描每秒120,000个点测量。这种高分辨率的精确扫描仪适用于扫描任何受损表面的显微分辨率表面拓扑，特征尺寸范围从0.005毫米到100mm或更长，非常长的距离高达300mm。TSMI扫描仪用于两种检查：空化拓扑扫描和叶片前缘扫描。对于空化扫描，根据给定的空腔位置列表，TSMI指向每个空腔，并对空腔表面进行编程扫描。在CTMA项目中，典型的空腔尺寸为3mm×3mm见方，这意味着扫描广泛分布在叶片样品表面的10个空腔需要30秒。对扫描结果应用可配置判据来确定叶片是否可修复。前缘检查包括两项测量。一个轮廓边缘和比较它与名义边缘轮廓，以估计磨损程度和边缘上的临界切屑。第二个轮廓边缘的横截面曲率，并将其与名义曲率进行比较", "中文源标题": "微米精度的快速敏捷三维扫描仪推进无损检测", "英文整编": "Supported by the \"Commercial Technology for Maintenance Activities\" (CTMA) program of the National Manufacturing Science Center of the United States, the \"Fast, Agile Micron Precision 3D Scanner for Nondestructive Testing\" project involving the Letterkenny Base of the US Army, the Eastern Fleet Readiness Center of the Navy and the Air Force Logistics Center of Oklahoma City has developed an affordable and integrated optical nondestructive testing system, which realizes automatic continuous testing, shortens the maintenance cycle of jet engine blades, reduces maintenance costs and improves testing accuracy.The nondestructive testing system is an integral and flexible platform, which can install sample blades and be tested by optical sensors.

One of the most well-known examples of smart materials is shape memory alloy (SMA), which is a type of metallic material that can change its shape in response to changes in temperature.\nAnother example of smart materials includes piezoelectric materials, which generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. Smart materials have a wide range of potential applications, including in aerospace, automotive, robotics, manufacturing, and biomedical engineering.\nVariable stiffness materials are a type of smart materials that have the ability to tune their stiffness, or resistance to deformation, in response to external stimuli. This property allows for the material to adapt to changing conditions and improve performance in a wide range of environments.\nOne of the main advantages of variable stiffness materials is that they can increase the efficiency, safety, and reliability of mechanical systems. For example, variable stiffness materials can be used to create robotic arms and grippers that can adapt to different objects and environments. This allows for the robotic arm or gripper to handle a range of different objects with different shapes, sizes, and weights, which can reduce the complexity and increase the overall efficiency of the robotic system.\nInnovative smart materials with tuneable electromechanical properties are revolutionizing the fields of manufacturing, wearable devices, and robotics. However, to date, a material that can intelligently self-tune its electrical and mechanical properties in response to environmental changes, and harness the altered properties synergistically without external control, has yet to be achieved.\nTo fill this gap, a collaborative research team led by Dr. Shiyang Tang at the University of Birmingham, along with collaborators from the University of Science and Technology of China, the University of Cambridge, and the University of Wollongong, developed a smart material called the Field's metal hybrid filler elastomer (FMHE). The FMHE comprises hybrid fillers of Field's metal (a non-toxic low-melting-point alloy) and spiked nickel microparticles embedded in an elastomer matrix.\nThis research was reported in their recent paper published in Science Advances.\nThe FMHE created by the researchers can respond to both mechanical strain and electrical currents, exhibiting variable and tuneable electrical conductivity and stiffness without external control. The melting and solidification of the Field's metal enable the change in stiffness. The FMHE also exhibits unconventional negative piezoresistivity and high strain sensitivity, with resistivity decreasing millions of times upon both compression and stretching.\nBy harnessing these properties in a synergistic manner, the researchers demonstrated two applications in intelligent and resilient systems, with over an order of magnitude performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. The first application is a self-triggered multi-axis compliance compensator that can protect robotic manipulators from excessive compressive, bending, and torsional movements.\nThe second application is a resettable current-limiting fuse that offers adjustable fusing currents and significantly outperforms commercial products in terms of compactness, range of operating current, and response speed.\n\"I am thrilled that our experiments and simulations have uncovered the mechanism behind the negative piezoresistive effect and the tuneable conductivity, strain sensitivity, and stiffness of this smart material. I hope this research is the beginning of the further study on this new material family, which has the potential to revolutionize the development of intelligent and resilient robotics and electronics,\" said Dr. Guolin Yun, the first author of the study.\n\"These self-responsive smart materials not only offer cost-saving opportunities but also increase reliability by reducing the need for complex control systems,\" said Dr. Shiyang Tang.\nThis study provides significant value to the fields of manufacturing, robotics, and electronics, potentially leading to the development of electromechanical systems with enhanced performance and functionality.\n", "中文原文": "智能材料是指能够对特定的外部刺激如温度、湿度、光或施加的应力做出响应而改变其性能的材料。形状记忆合金(SMA)是智能材料中最著名的例子之一，它是一种能随着温度变化而改变形状的金属材料。智能材料的另一个例子包括压电材料，它响应施加的机械应力产生电荷。智能材料在航空航天、汽车、机器人、制造和生物医学工程等领域具有广泛的应用前景。变刚度材料是一种智能材料，它能够对外界刺激做出反应，调整其刚度或抗变形能力。这种特性允许材料适应不断变化的条件，并在广泛的环境中提高性能。变刚度材料的主要优点之一是可以提高机械系统的效率、安全性和可靠性。例如，可变刚度材料可用于创建能够适应不同对象和环境的机械臂和抓取器。这使得机械臂或手爪能够处理一系列不同形状、大小和重量的不同物体，从而降低了机器人系统的复杂性，提高了系统的整体效率。具有可调机电性能的创新智能材料正在制造、可穿戴设备和机器人领域发生革命性变化。然而，到目前为止，一种材料能够智能地自调整其电学和机械性能以响应环境变化，并在没有外部控制的情况下协同地利用改变的性能，还有待于实现。为了填补这一空白，由伯明翰大学唐世扬博士领导的合作研究小组与中国科学技术大学、剑桥大学和卧龙岗大学的合作者一起开发了一种智能材料，称为该领域的金属混合填充弹性体(FMHE)。FMHE包括Field's金属（一种无毒的低熔点合金）和嵌在弹性体基体中的尖峰镍微粒的混合填料。这项研究发表在他们最近发表在《科学进展》上的论文中。研究人员创造的FMHE可以对机械应变和电流做出反应，在没有外部控制的情况下表现出可变和可调的电导率和刚度。磁场中金属的熔化和凝固使硬度发生变化。FMHE还表现出非常规的负压电阻率和高应变敏感性，电阻率在压缩和拉伸时都下降了数百万倍。通过协同利用这些特性，研究人员展示了在智能和弹性系统中的两种应用，与最先进的系统相比，性能提高了一个数量级。第一种应用是一种自触发多轴柔顺性补偿器，它可以保护机器人机械手免受过度的压缩、弯曲和扭转运动。第二种应用是一种可复位限流保险丝，它提供可调节的熔断电流，并且在紧凑性、工作电流范围和响应速度方面显著优于商业产品。该研究的第一作者云国林博士说：“我很高兴我们的实验和模拟揭示了负压阻效应背后的机制，以及这种智能材料的可调谐电导率、应变灵敏度和刚度。我希望这项研究是对这种新材料家族进一步研究的开始，它有可能彻底改变智能和弹性机器人和电子学的发展。”唐世扬博士说：“这些自我反应的智能材料不仅提供了节省成本的机会，还通过减少对复杂控制系统的需求来提高可靠性。”这项研究对制造业、机器人学和电子学领域具有重要的价值，潜在地导致具有增强性能和功能的机电系统的发展。", "中文源标题": "一种能自调刚度和导电性的灵巧弹性体", "英文整编": "A research team composed of Birmingham University, Cambridge University, Wollongong University and University of Science and Technology of China developed a smart material called Field's metal hybrid filler elastomer (FMHE), which has adjustable stiffness and conductivity.

Credit: HawkEye360\nSpace Systems Command is trying to figure out how to exploit traditional and new types of commercial space data\nWASHINGTON — Over a two-day conference last week, U.S. military and intelligence officials were briefed on the capabilities of commercial spy satellites and how data from these satellites could be used in military operations. \nDefense and intelligence agencies are longtime customers of commercial imagery companies and their consumption of commercial imagery has increased during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But there is also an emerging demand for new types of data now being collected by commercial satellites, such as radar imagery, radio-frequency signals, maritime and aerial traffic data. \nThe ability to capture and analyze data from multiple sources, and turn it into useful intelligence, is known in military speak as tactical space-based ISR, short for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. \nMore than 35 companies participated in the U.S. Space Force’s first industry day event May 19-20 focused on space-based ISR, a spokesperson said. The conference, held at an undisclosed location in the Washington, D.C. metro area, was organized by the Space Systems Command and the Aerospace Industries Association. \nJohn Galer, assistant vice president for national security space at the Aerospace Industries Association, said the command selected a mix of new space and traditional defense firms to brief a group of about 50 government officials on the state of technology for space-based ISR. \n“It was really an opportunity to have a conversation about what is available and what’s out there,” said Galer. “It was also an opportunity for Space Systems Command to talk about how they’re trying to do business in a different way.”\nSpeaking May 18 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the head of Space Systems Command Lt. Gen. Michael Guetlein said the tactical ISR industry day was part of a broader effort to better understand commercial industry capabilities which are advancing at a rapid pace. \nThe National Reconnaissance Office and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency acquire satellite imagery and data analytics services for the U.S. government. But the military is looking for ways to use satellites in direct support of battlefield operations, to track targets on the ground or ships at sea, for example.\nThe Space Force’s deputy director of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance Joseph Rouge said in February his office was tasked by Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall to examine how DoD could better use commercial capabilities for tactical ISR. \nIn support of this effort, the Space Systems Command is trying to figure out how tactical ISR would be procured from a diverse supplier base that includes satellite operators, sensor developers, data analytics firms and systems integrators. \nThe industry day was a first step in trying to define what tactical space ISR means and how it should be procured, said Galer. “Tactical ISR has not been precisely defined, and that’s probably one of the reasons they’re really having this conversation,” he said. “You have satellite providers, but also data analytics, cloud and artificial intelligence companies.”\nCommercial companies that provide geospatial intelligence see the military’s interest in tactical ISR as a significant business opportunity. \n“The U.S. government is seeing the benefits of commercial capabilities for high-resolution and frequent revisit imagery,” BlackSky CEO Brian O’Toole said in April. Military organizations, he said, also are interested in nontraditional services that combine traditional imagery collection with on-demand satellite tasking. \nJohn Serafini, CEO of radio-frequency data analytics company HawkEye 360, said the Space Force’s interest in commercial ISR is good news for the industry as “there is now a bullpen of commercial companies that can service that.”\n", "中文原文": "桑德拉·欧文-2022年5月23日鹰眼360使用天基射频数据来定位黑暗飞船的活动。信用:HawkEye360太空系统司令部正在研究如何利用传统的和新型的商业太空数据华盛顿--在上周为期两天的会议上，美国军方和情报官员听取了关于商业间谍卫星能力以及这些卫星数据如何用于军事行动的简报。国防和情报机构是商业图像公司的长期客户，在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰期间，他们对商业图像的消费增加了。但是，现在对商业卫星收集的新类型数据也有新的需求，如雷达图像、无线电频率信号、海上和空中交通数据。从多个来源捕获和分析数据并将其转化为有用情报的能力，在军事上被称为战术天基ISR，即情报、监视和侦察的简称。一位发言人说，超过35家公司参加了美国太空部队5月19日至20日的第一个工业日活动，重点是天基ISR。会议在华盛顿特区市区的一个秘密地点举行，由空间系统司令部和航空航天工业协会组织。航空航天工业协会（Aerospace Industries Association）负责国家安全空间的助理副总裁约翰·加勒（John Galer）表示，该司令部选择了新的航天和传统国防公司，向约50名政府官员介绍了天基ISR的技术状况。“这真的是一个机会，可以就什么是可用的，什么是存在的，”盖勒说。“这也是太空系统司令部谈论他们如何试图以不同的方式做生意的机会。”太空系统司令部司令迈克尔·盖特林中将5月18日在战略与国际研究中心发表讲话时说，战术ISR工业日是更广泛努力的一部分，以更好地理解快速发展的商业工业能力。国家侦察局和国家地理空间情报局为美国政府提供卫星图像和数据分析服务。但是军方正在寻找使用卫星直接支持战场行动的方法，例如跟踪地面目标或海上船只。太空部队情报、监视和侦察副主任约瑟夫·鲁日（Joseph Rouge）今年2月表示，空军部长弗兰克·肯德尔（Frank Kendall）委托他的办公室研究国防部如何更好地利用战术ISR的商业能力。为了支持这一努力，太空系统司令部正试图找出如何从包括卫星运营商、传感器开发商、数据分析公司和系统集成商在内的不同供应商基础上采购战术ISR。Galer说，工业日是试图定义战术空间ISR意味着什么以及应该如何采购的第一步。“战术ISR还没有被精确定义，这可能是他们真正进行这次对话的原因之一，”他说。“你有卫星提供商，也有数据分析、云和人工智能公司。”提供地理空间情报的商业公司将军方对战术ISR的兴趣视为一个重要的商业机会。BlackSky首席执行官布莱恩·奥图尔（Brian O'Toole)在4月份表示：“美国政府正在看到高分辨率和频繁重访图像的商业能力的好处。”他说，军事组织也对将传统图像收集与按需卫星任务相结合的非传统服务感兴趣。射频数据分析公司鹰眼360的首席执行官约翰·塞拉菲尼（John Serafini）表示，太空部队对商业ISR的兴趣对该行业来说是个好消息，因为“现在有一个商业公司的牛棚可以为之服务。”", "中文源标题": "军方寻找获取和使用商业卫星数据的新途径", "英文整编": "From May 19 to 20, the US-Pacific Air Force held the first Industrial Day with the theme of space-based \"Intelligence Reconnaissance and Surveillance\" (ISR) in a secret place in Washington.

Image via Pasquali Research Group/Rice University.\n3D printing carbon nanotubes\nSince their discovery back in 1991, carbon nanotubes have been hailed as being up to a hundred times stronger than steel, harder than diamonds, and a thousand times more conductive than copper. While studies have proposed a range of potentially significant industrial applications of carbon nanotubes, such as electronics and water purification filters, the technology is still very much in development.\nAt present, carbon nanotubes can be utilized to develop composite materials that have superior mechanical, thermal, and conductive properties, however, leveraging them for 3D printing still presents significant challenges.\nSo far, carbon nanotube materials have been used to 3D print shape memory polymers for use in soft robotic applications, and due to their biocompatibility have also been used to 3D print tissue scaffolds.\nIn April last year, Arizona-based start-up Mechnano exited stealth mode in the R&D of its carbon nanotube technology for 3D printing materials with the launch of its electrostatic discharge (ESD) resin. The firm claims to be the first to have fabricated parts with carbon nanotubes using material jetting and vat photopolymerization systems, and believes its technology will bring “dramatic changes” to industries such as aerospace, defense, medical and automotive.\nA 3D-printed cylinder is made entirely of carbon nanotube ink developed at Rice University. Photo via Pasquali Research Group/Rice University.\nUntangling nanotube spaghetti\nOne of the challenges of processing carbon nanotubes is their susceptibility to tangling, reflective of the dreaded “spaghetti” effect when a print job goes wrong, which until now has prevented researchers from realizing their full potential.\nAccording to the Rice University team, separating the nanotubes is a necessary step before they can be extruded during 3D printing or where shear forces transform them into familiar fibers or sheets.\nThe team has developed an acid-based solvent that helps to separate tangled nanotubes in a solution and turn them into films, fibers, or other materials that exhibit excellent electrical and mechanical properties. The solvent is made up of a unique combination of acids, namely methanesulfonic (MSA), p-toluenesulfonic (pToS), and oleum acids, that when combined are less corrosive than those currently used within nanotube processing.\nOleum and chlorosulfonic acids have been used to separate nanotubes for some time, however are highly corrosive. Combining oleum with the weaker MSA and pToS acids has enabled the creation of a broadly applicable process allowing new manufacturing opportunities for carbon nanotube parts.\n“The oleum surrounds each individual nanotube and gives it a very localized positive charge,” said Robert Headrick, a graduate alumnus of Rice University involved in the study and current Research Scientist at Shell. “That charge makes them repel each other.”\nAfter the detangling stage, the MSA and pToS acids further separate the nanotubes. The researchers observed MSA was best-suited to fiber spinning and roll-to-roll film production, while pToS is suited to 3D printing applications due to its 40 degree celsius melting point allowing nanotube solutions to be processed at a moderate temperature then solidified by cooling.\nThe team then used the stable liquid crystalline solutions to 3D print carbon nanotube aerogels, as well as silk screen printing patterns onto a range of different surfaces. They found that MSA and pToS did not give off harmful fumes during the process and were easily cleaned up afterward. The acids can also be recycled after the process has been completed, lowering environmental impact, energy, and processing costs.\n“The acids we’re using are so much gentler that you can use them with common plastics,” added Headrick. “That opens the door to a lot of materials processing and printing techniques that are already in place in manufacturing facilities.\n“IT’S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR INTEGRATING CARBON NANOTUBES INTO OTHER DEVICES, DEPOSITING THEM AS ONE STEP IN A DEVICE-MANUFACTURING PROCESS.”\nFine-tuning the next steps\nThe Rice University team’s research was supported by several notable organizations, including the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the US Department of Energy, the NASA Space Technology Research Institute, and the Robert A. Welch Foundation.\nThe next step for the team is to fine-tune the solvent for various specific applications and to determine how factors like chirality, when an object is distinguishable from its mirror image, and size affect nanotube processing. The researchers also pressed the importance of achieving high-quality, clean large diameter tubes.\nFurther information on the study can be found in the paper titled: “Versatile acid solvents for pristine carbon nanotube assembly,” published in the Science Advances journal. The study was co-authored by R. Headrick, S. Williams, C. Owens, L. Taylor, O. Dewey, C. Ginestra, L. Liberman, A. Ya’akobi, Y. Talmon, B. Maruyama, G. McKinley, A. Hart, and M.

Once deployed to the island, Charlie Battery, 1st Battalion, 174th Air Defense Artillery Regiment will conduct strategic deployment and joint training alongside 1st Squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division.\nThe Avenger Air Defense System, designated AN/TWQ-1 under the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, is an American self-propelled surface-to-air missile system which provides mobile, short-range air defense protection for ground units against cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles, low-flying fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters. Originally developed as a private venture by Boeing in the 1980s. The Avenger was originally developed for the United States Armed Forces and is currently used by the U.S. Army. The Avenger system was also used by the U.S. Marine Corps. The Avenger comes mainly in three configurations, the Basic, Slew-to-Cue, and the Up-Gun. The first operational deployment of the system occurred during the buildup for the Persian Gulf War.\nThe Basic configuration consists of a gyro-stabilized air defense turret mounted on a modified heavy Humvee. The turret has two Stinger missile launcher pods, each capable of firing up to 4 fire-and-forget infrared/ultraviolet guided missiles in rapid succession. The Avenger can be linked to the Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (FAAD C3I) system, which permits external radar tracks and messages to be passed to the fire unit to alert and cue the gunner. The right missile pod was removed and the M3P 12.7 mm (.50) cal machine gun was moved to the pod’s former position. This allowed for the removal of the turret’s cab safety limits which enabled the gun to be fired directly in front of the HMMWV.\nExercising military mobility processes and agreements ensures our troops and equipment can deploy across the Indo-Pacific region without delay for exercises in peacetime or supplying reinforcements in an emerging crisis or contingency. As Forager 21 comes to an end in the middle of August 2021, the steps are already in motion to transport the 1-174th supplies and vehicles back to Ohio. Exercise Forager 21 is a U.S. Army Pacific exercise designed to test and refine the Theater Army’s ability to flow land power forces into the theater, execute command and control of those forces, and effectively employ them in support of our allies, partners, and national security objectives in the region.\n", "中文原文": "2021年7月28日，关岛，分配到第174防空炮兵团第一营的士兵将他们的复仇者防空系统和其他军车运送到世界各地，以便参加觅食者21号演习。在民用承包商和分配到第7运输旅的士兵的帮助下，这些车辆被装载到一个前往蒂尼安的陆军船只系统上。一旦部署到该岛，第174防空炮兵团第1营查理炮台将与第2步兵师第1斯特赖克旅战斗队第14骑兵团第1中队进行战略部署和联合训练。复仇者防空系统在联合电子型号命名系统下被命名为AN/TWQ-1，是一种美国自行地对空导弹系统，为地面单位提供机动、近程防空保护，以对抗巡航导弹、无人机、低飞固定翼飞机和直升机。最初由波音公司在20世纪80年代作为私人企业开发。复仇者最初是为美国武装部队开发的，目前被美国陆军使用。复仇者系统也被美国海军陆战队使用。复仇者主要有三种配置，基本的，旋转到线索，和上枪。该系统的第一次作战部署发生在波斯湾战争的集结期间。基本配置由安装在改装重型悍马车上的陀螺稳定防空炮塔组成。炮塔上有两个毒刺导弹发射吊舱，每个吊舱能够连续快速发射多达4枚发射-忘记红外/紫外线制导导弹。复仇者可以与前沿地区防空指挥、控制、通信和情报系统（FAAD C3I)连接，该系统允许外部雷达跟踪和信息传递给火力单位，以警告和提示枪手。右导弹吊舱被移除，M3P12.7毫米(0.50)cal机枪被移到吊舱的前位置。这使得炮塔驾驶室的安全限制被取消，这使得火炮可以直接在HMMWV的前面发射。行使军事机动程序和协议确保我们的部队和装备可以毫不拖延地部署在印度-太平洋地区，用于和平时期的演习或在新出现的危机或突发事件中提供增援。随着觅食者21号将于2021年8月中旬结束，将第1-174批物资和车辆运回俄亥俄州的步骤已经开始。Forager 21演习是美国陆军太平洋演习，旨在测试和完善战区陆军向战区输送陆地力量的能力，执行对这些力量的指挥和控制，并有效地利用它们支持我们的盟友、伙伴和该地区的国家安全目标。", "中文源标题": "美国陆军将复仇者防空系统装载到Forager21的陆军船艇系统上", "英文整编": "On July 28, 2021, the 1st Battalion of the 174th Air Defense Regiment of the U.S. Army was transporting Avengers air defense systems and other military vehicles around the world to prepare for the Forager 21 exercise.

This new fab will be located next to the existing LFAB1 facility that TI purchased from Micron in 2021. \nProduction at LFAB1 began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Both facilities will initially support 65nm and 45nm technologies to produce TI’s analog and embedded processing ICs.\nGoodbye Chip Shortages, Hello Revenue Declines\nThe severe chip shortages and sharp revenue growth of 26.3% in 2021 have not completely faded from our collective memories. It was those shortages and supply chain issues that initially created the environment for more wafer fab announcements. The value of the U.S.-based semiconductor projects that are planned or under construction through 2030 has been estimated at over $223B.\nHowever, TI is announcing this capacity investment in a different economic climate. In 2022, TI’s revenue increased 9% from $18.3B to $20.0B. That growth was twice the industry average of 4%. \nNow, Garter is forecasting a 3.6% decline in 2023. In a recent earnings call, TI confirmed that order cancellations had increased, and revenue from its industrial business fell 10% in Q4 compared to 2021. So, TI is clearly feeling the pinch from the economic downturn.\nPlaying the Long Game \nThe semiconductor industry is no stranger to boom-and-bust cycles. Companies like TI have to balance the short-term outlook, as seen in 2023, with the long-term potential for continued growth in the electronics industry. \nConstruction at Lehi is targeted to begin in the second half of 2023, and the first production from LFAB2 is expected no earlier than 2026. A 2023 demand downturn will have no direct impact on the new facility. \nWhen discussing the Lehi investment, Haviv Ilan, TI executive vice president and chief operating officer and incoming president and chief executive officer, commented that TI is anticipating the growth of semiconductors, particularly in industrial and automotive markets. \nCHIPS and Science Act—Hurry Up and Wait?\nThe Department of Commerce asserts that “the U.S. must move quickly” to build new semiconductor facilities considered critical to U.S. economic and national security. \nWhen discussing the Lehi investment, TI’s Ilan commented that the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act contributed to their view that now is an excellent time for TI to invest in manufacturing capacity. However, six months after the CHIPS and Science Act was signed into law in August, the department has yet to to release the first Notice of Funding Opportunity. \nThe current plans are for the Department of Commerce to release its first funding announcement in late February for both front-end semiconductor manufacturers and back-end packaging facilities. The new TI facility in Lehi would likely fall into that first category, but it is unclear if or how much this fab could be impacted by future CHIPS funding if awarded.\nIn late spring, the Department of Commerce anticipates a second funding announcement for material suppliers and equipment manufacturers. This is expected to be followed in the fall by funding opportunities to support the construction of semiconductor R&D facilities. \nState Tax Credits Also Play a Role\nThe U.S. federal government isn’t the only level of government getting involved in supporting the construction of these new facilities. TI was awarded a post-performance tax reduction for the new Lehi fab from the Utah Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity. \nTI expects LFAB2 to create 800 new, high-tech jobs. Using the 20-year projections, the LFAB2 is forecasted to generate $111M in new tax revenue for the state of Utah. TI can receive up to a 30% credit on those taxes for a potential savings of $33M over the two-decade span of the agreement.\nMore Chips and Increased Efficiency\nTI also announced that the Lehi LFAB2 will be designed to meet the LEED Gold standard for green buildings. The company plans to recycle water at nearly twice the rate of LFAB1. Advances in 300 mm equipment and processes are expected to contribute to additional reductions in waste, water, and energy consumption.\nTI is betting on LFAB2 being ready in the second half of this decade to produce tens of millions of analog and embedded processing chips daily. And this is just a portion of their planned capital expenditures to expand their manufacturing capacity. \n", "中文原文": "德克萨斯仪器公司宣布在犹他州莱希建立第二个300毫米半导体晶圆制造厂，以满足预期的集成电路需求增长。2月15日，德克萨斯仪器公司(TI)宣布选择犹他州的莱希作为新的110亿美元半导体制造设施的建设地点，该设施将被称为LFAB2。这个新的晶圆厂将位于TI于2021年从美光购买的现有LFAB1设施旁边。LFAB1的生产始于2022年第四季度。这两个设施最初将支持65nm和45nm技术，以生产TI的模拟和嵌入式处理IC。再见芯片短缺，你好收入下滑2021年严重的芯片短缺和26.3%的营收大幅增长并没有完全从我们的集体记忆中褪去。正是这些短缺和供应链问题最初创造了更多晶圆厂公告的环境。截至2030年，计划或在建的美国半导体项目的价值估计超过2230亿美元。然而，TI在一个不同的经济环境下宣布了这项产能投资。2022年，TI的收入增长了9%，从183亿美元增加到20.0美元。这一增长率是行业平均水平4%的两倍。现在，加特预测2023年将下降3.6%。在最近的一次财报电话会议上，TI证实，订单取消有所增加，与2021年相比，第四季度工业业务收入下降了10%。因此，TI显然感受到了经济低迷带来的压力。玩长期游戏半导体行业对繁荣和萧条周期并不陌生。像TI这样的公司必须平衡2023年的短期前景和电子行业持续增长的长期潜力。Lehi的建设目标是在2023年下半年开始，LFAB2的第一次生产预计不早于2026年。2023年的需求低迷不会对新设施产生直接影响。TI执行副总裁兼首席运营官、即将上任的总裁兼首席执行官Haviv Ilan在讨论Lehi投资时表示，TI预计半导体的增长，尤其是在工业和汽车市场。芯片和科学行动--快点等？美国商务部声称，“美国必须迅速行动”，建设被认为对美国经济和国家安全至关重要的新半导体设施。在讨论Lehi的投资时，TI的伊兰评论说，《芯片和科学法案》的通过有助于他们的观点，即现在是TI投资生产能力的绝佳时机。然而，在《芯片和科学法案》于8月份签署成为法律六个月后，该部门尚未发布第一份资助机会通知。目前的计划是，商务部将在2月底发布第一份针对前端半导体制造商和后端封装设施的融资公告。位于莱希的新TI设施可能属于第一类，但尚不清楚如果获得奖励，该晶圆厂是否或在多大程度上会受到未来芯片资金的影响。在春末，商务部预计将宣布对材料供应商和设备制造商的第二次资助。预计今年秋季将有资金机会支持半导体研发设施的建设。国家税收抵免也发挥了作用美国联邦政府并不是唯一参与支持这些新设施建设的政府级别。TI获得了犹他州州长经济机会办公室为新的莱希晶圆厂提供的绩效后减税。TI预计LFAB2将创造800个新的高科技工作岗位。根据20年的预测，LFAB2预计将为犹他州带来1.11亿美元的新税收。TI可以在这些税收上获得高达30%的抵免，在协议的20年时间里，可能节省3300万美元。芯片更多，效率更高TI还宣布，Lehi LFAB2的设计将符合LEED绿色建筑黄金标准。该公司计划以几乎两倍于LFAB1的速度循环水。300毫米设备和工艺的进步预计将有助于进一步减少废物、水和能源消耗。TI押注于LFAB2将在本十年的后半期准备好每天生产数千万个模拟和嵌入式处理芯片。而这只是他们扩大制造能力的计划资本支出的一部分。", "中文源标题": "在美国晶圆厂市场不确定的情况下，TI宣布在犹他州建立300mm晶圆厂", "英文整编": "Recently, Texas Instruments announced that it will build a second 300 mm wafer factory in Lehai, Utah, USA, to meet the expected growth of chip demand.

Gen. Shawn N. Bratton said during an AFA Air and Space Warfighters in Action virtual seminar. \n“We had a request before STARCOM even stood up to develop a command and control exercise for the Space Force, really geared at the ops center level—so what would be the AOC equivalents, or for us the [Combined Space Operations Center] out of Vandenberg [Space Force Base, Calif.] or the National Space Defense Center here in Colorado Springs,” Bratton said.\nSTARCOM officially stood up this past August, making it the newest of three field commands under the Space Force. And with only a few months under its belt, the new command has plenty of work to do to develop the training doctrines and exercises that will shape the new service branch, Bratton said.\n“We’ll have our first go here in [2022], and see how that goes and if we’re meeting the training objectives,” Bratton said of Polaris Hammer. “And then, of course, we continue to support the combatant command tier one exercises, getting after that. But … we need to develop a little more of that on the service side, and from my seat, really … tease out the doctrine we need to gain and maintain space superiority.”\nThat won’t be the only exercise that STARCOM organizes in 2022, though. Bratton said the command is set to host an “initial planning conference” in the coming weeks for an exercise called Black Skies, intended to be a more focused version of the Space Flag exercise.\n“We do an exercise today called Space Flag that is probably most akin to Red Flag, but it’s sort of got everything in it, and it tries to be everything to everybody,” Bratton said. “I think we’ll break that out into pieces over time, starting with [electronic warfare.]”\nThat’s not to say the Space Force won’t continue to run Space Flag exercises, Bratton added, but they hope to develop more specific exercises “modeled” after the Air Force’s Flag exercises.\n“I think there’s nothing too creative going on here, but we replaced ‘Flag’ with ‘Sky,’ and I see the Space Force going down that road of Black Skies, Blue Skies, Red Skies exercises to get after the needs of those specific training audiences,” said Bratton.\nThe Air Force uses Red Flag exercises for aerial combat training, Black Flag exercises as a way to test large weapons and capabilities, and Blue Flag exercises to train participants at the operational level.

But separating the valuable elements from other minerals and components found in e-waste proves to be a challenge.\nIn a recent paper in the Chemical Engineering Journal, Amir Sheikhi, assistant professor of chemical engineering and biomedical engineering, at Penn State, details a new nanotechnology to separate neodymium using plant cellulose, which is found in paper, cotton and pulp. Patrictia Wamea, a former member of Sheikhi's lab who graduated in May with a master of science degree, co-authored the paper and earned the Penn State Department of Chemical Engineering's annual Best Paper Award in fall 2021 for her contributions.\nIn the process, hairy cellulose nanocrystals, nanoparticles derived from cellulose fibrils, bind selectively to neodymium ions, separating them from other ions, such as iron, calcium and sodium, according to Sheikhi. The nanoparticles are known as \"hairy\" due to cellulose chains attached to their two ends, which perform critical chemical functions.\nTo do this, the researchers negatively charged the hairy layers of the nanoparticles in order to attract and bind with the positively charged neodymium ions, resulting in particle aggregation into larger pieces that can then be effectively recycled and reused.\n\"The process is effective in its removal capacity, selectivity and in its speed,\" Sheikhi said. \"It can separate neodymium in seconds by selectively removing the element from some of the tested impurities.\"\nCurrent rare earth element recycling processes are environmentally detrimental, according to Sheikhi. They often use highly acidic conditions to extract the elements in chemical reactions. Sheikhi's process is environmentally friendly due to its use of cellulose, which is an inexpensive renewable resource. The traditional mining process is dangerous and expensive, with harmful environmental impacts from open-pit mining.\n\"Using cellulose as the main agent is a sustainable, cost-effective, clean solution,\" Sheikhi said. \"Using this process, the United States will be able to compete with other giants like China to recover rare earth materials and independently produce them.\"\nChina is the leading exporter of neodymium, according to Sheikhi, exporting more than 70% of the world's supply of the material.\nIn addition to e-waste, rare earth elements like neodymium can be extracted from industrial wastewater, mining tails and permanent magnets that are no longer in use. In the future, Sheikhi said he hopes the cellulose-based adsorption process can be applied to those sources as well.\n\"This contribution to rare earth recycling will have a strategic and economically-viable impact on several industries,\" Sheikhi said. \"The more neodymium we recycle, the more we can manufacture electric and hybrid vehicles and wind turbines, leading to less strain on the environment.\"\n", "中文原文": "制造商依赖钕等稀土元素来制造用于电子产品马达的强磁铁，包括混合动力汽车、飞机发电机、扬声器、硬盘驱动器和入耳式耳机。但是含有钕的矿藏很难找到，只在地球上的几个地方发现。随着几个行业对钕的需求不断增加，人们的注意力转向回收旧电脑和印刷电路板中的元素，以满足需求。但是从电子垃圾中发现的其他矿物和成分中分离有价值的元素被证明是一个挑战。在《化学工程杂志》最近的一篇论文中，宾夕法尼亚州立大学化学工程和生物医学工程助理教授阿米尔·谢赫（Amir Sheikhi）详细描述了一种利用植物纤维素分离钕的新纳米技术，植物纤维素存在于纸、棉花和纸浆中。Patrictia Wamea是谢赫实验室的前成员，于5月毕业，获得了科学硕士学位，她与人合著了这篇论文，并因其贡献获得了宾夕法尼亚州立大学化学工程部2021年秋季的年度最佳论文奖。谢赫说，在这个过程中，毛状纤维素纳米晶体，来自纤维素纤维的纳米颗粒，选择性地与钕离子结合，将它们与铁、钙和钠等其他离子分离。纳米颗粒被称为“毛状”，因为它们的两端连接着纤维素链，发挥着关键的化学功能。为了做到这一点，研究人员给纳米颗粒的毛层带负电，以吸引带正电荷的钕离子并与之结合，导致颗粒聚集成更大的碎片，然后可以有效地回收和重复使用。谢赫说：“这一过程在去除能力、选择性和速度方面是有效的。”“它可以在几秒钟内通过选择性地从一些被测试的杂质中移除钕来分离钕.”谢赫说，目前的稀土元素回收过程对环境有害。他们经常使用高酸性条件提取化学反应中的元素。谢赫的工艺是环保的，因为它使用纤维素，纤维素是一种廉价的可再生资源。传统的采矿过程是危险和昂贵的，露天开采会对环境产生有害的影响。谢赫说：“使用纤维素作为主要试剂是一种可持续的、成本效益高的、清洁的解决方案。”“利用这一工艺，美国将能够与中国这样的其他巨头竞争，回收稀土材料并自主生产。”谢赫说，中国是钕的主要出口国，出口了全球70%以上的钕。除了电子垃圾，像钕这样的稀土元素可以从工业废水、矿尾和不再使用的永磁体中提取。谢赫说，他希望未来基于纤维素的吸附过程也能应用于这些来源。谢赫说：“对稀土回收的这一贡献将对几个行业产生战略和经济上可行的影响。”“我们回收的钕越多，我们就越能制造电动和混合动力汽车以及风力涡轮机，从而减少对环境的压力。”", "中文源标题": "从电子废弃物中回收稀土元素", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at Pennsylvania State University developed a method to recover rare earth elements from electronic waste.

Gen. John Morrison told reporters at the AFCEA TechNet Augusta 2022 conference. “That foundation has now been set. We are putting the requisite capabilities into the hands of our operational formation so they can understand the applications that now need to move to the cloud and we are aligning the requisite combat power to assist in that migration.

It’s about the applications and the data that’s in the data center,” Morrison said. “What is cloud ready, what is not cloud ready, etcetera. And that’s sort of been where we’ve gotten a little pitchy at times. And so we set up a mechanism where we’re going to be able to go in and essentially, in an automated fashion, audit data centers, understand exactly what’s there.”\nThis will allow the service to see what’s cloud-ready and what isn’t, and that analysis in turn will allow the service to move “much more faster, efficiently and effectively” in its cloud efforts, he added.\nThe Army’s own cloud efforts are aligned to theJoint Warfighting Cloud Capability, the Defense Department’s new enterprise cloud effort valued at up to $9 billion.

To realize the true feeling of a face-to-face dialog, three dimensional video is required and yet the holographic technology is still missing. Researchers at the University of Stuttgart in Germany have now introduced a completely new approach to realize such dynamic holographic displays, based on electrically switchable plasmonic nanoantennas made from conductive metallic polymers. This key element provides the missing technology to enable holographic displays at video rate, which would enable virtual conferences with a \"real-life\" feeling. The paper detailing this work has been published in the journal Science on 29 October 2021.\nHolograms creating impressive three-dimensional static images are well known. Dynamic holograms switchable at video rates using data from a high-speed internet connection are not possible until now. Previously, the limiting factor was the display resolution. Holographic images require a resolution of 50 000 dpi (pixels per inch) which is 100x more than the best smartphone displays. For such a resolution one has to reduce the pixel size to half a micrometer (one thousands of a millimeter). However, current liquid-crystal technology does not allow for such small pixels, being limited to a few micrometers pixel size.\nResearchers at the University of Stuttgart have succeeded in breaking this fundamental barrier. In an interdisciplinary collaboration between Physics and Chemistry, they developed the idea to use electrically switchable plasmonic nanoantennas with dimensions of only a few hundred nanometers and made from conductive polymers.\nFor several years, researchers had created metasurfaces that generate static 3-dimensional holograms. However, their components, or nanoantennas, consisted of metals such as gold or aluminum that could not be switched like common liquid crystal materials. After searching for several years for the right material, Ph.D. student Julian Karst and nanophotonics expert Dr. Mario Hentschel from the group of Prof. Harald Giessen, together with polymer chemist Prof. Sabine Ludwigs and her team, identified electrically conducting polymers as possible candidates for switchable plasmonics. Sabine Ludwigs contributed her expertise on electrochemical switching of such functional polymers, that were at the focus of the 2000 Chemistry Nobel Prize.\nUntil now such materials had mostly been used for current transport in flexible displays and solar cells. In collaboration with cleanroom head Monika Ubl, Karst and Hentschel developed a process to nanostructure the metallic polymers using a combination of electron beam lithography and etching, thereby creating the plasmonic nanoantennas. The team showed that the optical appearance of the nanoantennas could be switched between that of a shiny metal and a transparent material by applying a voltage between minus and plus one volt. This switching effect works even at video rates of 30 Hertz. Despite being only a few tens of nanometers thick and less than 400 nanometers in size, the nanoantennas do the same job as the much larger and thicker liquid crystals used in current state-of-the-art technology. These new devices reach the required pixel densities of about 50.000 dpi.\nKarst created a simple hologram metasurface from the nanoantennas that could deflect an infrared laser beam 10 degrees onto one side by applying a voltage. Currently, he is working on making this deflection available for many angles for applications in LIDAR devices in autonomous vehicles, of keen interest to the automotive industry. Additionally, Karst created a hologram that behaves like an optical lens, which can be turned on and off by simply applying ±1 Volt. This technology is crucial for future smartphone cameras or optical sensors that could be zoomed from wide angle to telephoto by switching the applied voltage. Currently, up to four lenses are required for this functionality.\nIn the future, Prof. Harald Giessen and his team aim to address every single pixel individually, to dynamically change the holograms at will at video rates. Also, the optical properties of the polymer nanoantennas have to be shifted into the visible wavelength range, which requires collaborations with chemists and material scientists. Together with engineers, integrated and dynamically switchable optical displays and the first moving holograms could be integrated into AR/VR goggles and eventually onto smartphone screens and even televisions.\nApplying Moore's law to display technology, this advance by about a factor of 100 could happen commercially around the year 2035.\n", "中文原文": "视频会议在新冠肺炎疫情期间发挥了关键作用，并将在未来主导许多会议。为了实现面对面对话的真实感觉，需要三维视频，而全息技术仍然缺乏。德国斯图加特大学的研究人员现在介绍了一种全新的方法来实现这种动态全息显示，这种方法基于由导电金属聚合物制成的电可切换等离子体纳米天线。这一关键元素提供了缺失的技术，以视频速率实现全息显示，这将使虚拟会议具有“现实生活”的感觉。详细介绍这项工作的论文已发表在2021年10月29日的《科学》杂志上。全息图创造令人印象深刻的三维静态图像是众所周知的。利用高速互联网连接的数据以视频速率切换的动态全息图直到现在还不可能。以前，限制因素是显示分辨率。全息图像需要50000 dpi（每英寸像素）的分辨率，比最好的智能手机显示器高100倍。对于这样的分辨率，必须将像素尺寸缩小到半微米（千分之一毫米）。然而，目前的液晶技术不允许如此小的像素，被限制在几微米像素大小。斯图加特大学的研究人员成功地打破了这一根本障碍。在物理学和化学之间的跨学科合作中，他们提出了使用尺寸只有几百纳米、由导电聚合物制成的可电切换的等离子体纳米天线的想法。几年来，研究人员已经创建了生成静态三维全息图的元表面。然而，它们的组件，或者说纳米天线，是由金或铝等金属组成的，它们不能像普通的液晶材料那样被切换。Harald Giessen教授小组的博士生Julian Karst和纳米光子学专家Mario Hentschel博士，以及聚合物化学家Sabine Ludwigs教授和她的团队，经过数年寻找合适的材料，确定了导电聚合物可能是可切换等离子体源的候选材料。Sabine Ludwigs在这种功能聚合物的电化学开关方面贡献了她的专业知识，这是2000年诺贝尔化学奖的焦点。到目前为止，这种材料主要用于柔性显示器和太阳能电池中的电流传输。Karst和Hentschel与cleanroom head Monika Ubl合作，开发了一种利用电子束光刻和蚀刻相结合的方法来纳米化金属聚合物，从而制造出等离子体纳米天线。研究小组表明，通过施加负一伏特到正一伏特之间的电压，纳米天线的光学外观可以在闪亮的金属和透明的材料之间切换。这种切换效果即使在30赫兹的视频速率下也能工作。尽管只有几十纳米厚，尺寸不到400纳米，但纳米天线的工作与当前最先进技术中使用的更大更厚的液晶相同。这些新设备达到了大约50.000dpi所需的像素密度。喀斯特利用纳米天线创造了一个简单的全息图元表面，通过施加电压，可以将红外激光束偏转到一侧10度。目前，他正致力于使这种偏转在自动驾驶汽车的激光雷达设备中的许多应用角度上可用，这是汽车工业的热衷。此外，喀斯特创造了一个像光学透镜一样的全息图，只需施加±1伏特就可以打开和关闭。这项技术对未来的智能手机摄像头或光学传感器至关重要，这些传感器可以通过切换外加电压从广角变焦到长焦。目前，最多需要四个镜头的功能。在未来，哈拉尔德·吉森教授和他的团队的目标是单独处理每一个像素，以视频速率动态地随意改变全息图。此外，聚合物纳米天线的光学特性必须转移到可见光波长范围，这需要与化学家和材料科学家的合作。与工程师们一起，集成的动态切换光学显示器和第一批移动全息图可以集成到AR/VR护目镜中，最终集成到智能手机屏幕上，甚至电视上。将摩尔定律应用于显示技术，这一大约100倍的进步可能在2035年左右实现商业化。", "中文源标题": "电开关纳米天线可实现全息视频技术", "英文整编": "Recently, Stuttgart University in Germany proposed a method to develop nano-scale electrically switchable plasma nano-antenna using conductive polymer, which is expected to realize holographic video technology.

The constellation, therefore, would create network of cameras that all satellites orbiting the Earth would pass through.\nPutting sensors in LEO allows tabs to be kept on satellites even where ground-based systems lose sight of them — for example, in the Southern Hemisphere where the Space Command’s Space Surveillance Network is nearly blind.\nRecommended\nWhite House crafting rules framework for emerging space activities\nThe White House announcement comes after the FCC indicated it was wading into the murky regulatory waters of space-space services like satellite repair and refueling.\nBy Theresa Hitchens\nBain explained that in a recent simulation created for an allied government, the company showed its satellites monitoring “six potentially non-friendly satellites coming from either Russian or Chinese origin over the period of nine days.” During that time, North Star picked up a total of “five and a half million tracked images” where current ground-based telescopes and radar “would have had zero.”\nThe first step, Bain said, is to launch three of North Star’s optical sensors on CubeSats (12U sized) provided by Spire Global, under a “space as a service” agreement announced in March.

But when artificial intelligence learns something new, it tends to forget information it already learned.\nAs companies use more and more data to improve how AI recognizes images, learns languages and carries out other complex tasks, a paper publishing in Science this week shows a way that computer chips could dynamically rewire themselves to take in new data like the brain does, helping AI to keep learning over time.\n\"The brains of living beings can continuously learn throughout their lifespan. We have now created an artificial platform for machines to learn throughout their lifespan,\" said Shriram Ramanathan, a professor in Purdue University's School of Materials Engineering who specializes in discovering how materials could mimic the brain to improve computing.\nUnlike the brain, which constantly forms new connections between neurons to enable learning, the circuits on a computer chip don't change. A circuit that a machine has been using for years isn't any different than the circuit that was originally built for the machine in a factory.\nThis is a problem for making AI more portable, such as for autonomous vehicles or robots in space that would have to make decisions on their own in isolated environments. If AI could be embedded directly into hardware rather than just running on software as AI typically does, these machines would be able to operate more efficiently.\nIn this study, Ramanathan and his team built a new piece of hardware that can be reprogrammed on demand through electrical pulses. Ramanathan believes that this adaptability would allow the device to take on all of the functions that are necessary to build a brain-inspired computer.\n\"If we want to build a computer or a machine that is inspired by the brain, then correspondingly, we want to have the ability to continuously program, reprogram and change the chip,\" Ramanathan said.\nToward building a brain in chip form\nThe hardware is a small, rectangular device made of a material called perovskite nickelate, which is very sensitive to hydrogen. Applying electrical pulses at different voltages allows the device to shuffle a concentration of hydrogen ions in a matter of nanoseconds, creating states that the researchers found could be mapped out to corresponding functions in the brain.\nWhen the device has more hydrogen near its center, for example, it can act as a neuron, a single nerve cell. With less hydrogen at that location, the device serves as a synapse, a connection between neurons, which is what the brain uses to store memory in complex neural circuits.\nThrough simulations of the experimental data, the Purdue team's collaborators at Santa Clara University and Portland State University showed that the internal physics of this device creates a dynamic structure for an artificial neural network that is able to more efficiently recognize electrocardiogram patterns and digits compared to static networks. This neural network uses \"reservoir computing,\" which explains how different parts of a brain communicate and transfer information.\nResearchers from The Pennsylvania State University also demonstrated in this study that as new problems are presented, a dynamic network can \"pick and choose\" which circuits are the best fit for addressing those problems.\nSince the team was able to build the device using standard semiconductor-compatible fabrication techniques and operate the device at room temperature, Ramanathan believes that this technique can be readily adopted by the semiconductor industry.\n\"We demonstrated that this device is very robust,\" said Michael Park, a Purdue Ph.D. student in materials engineering. \"After programming the device over a million cycles, the reconfiguration of all functions is remarkably reproducible.\"\nThe researchers are working to demonstrate these concepts on large-scale test chips that would be used to build a brain-inspired computer.\nExperiments at Purdue were conducted at the FLEX Lab and Birck Nanotechnology Center of Purdue's Discovery Park. The team's collaborators at Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Illinois, Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Georgia conducted measurements of the device's properties.\n", "中文原文": "当人脑学习新东西时，它就适应了。但是当人工智能学习新的东西时，它往往会忘记已经学到的信息。随着企业使用越来越多的数据来改善人工智能识别图像、学习语言和执行其他复杂任务的方式，本周发表在《科学》杂志上的一篇论文展示了一种方法，即计算机芯片可以像大脑一样动态地重新连接自己以接收新数据，帮助人工智能随着时间的推移不断学习。普渡大学材料工程学院教授Shriram Ramanathan说：“生物的大脑可以在整个生命周期内不断学习。我们现在已经为机器创造了一个在整个生命周期内学习的人工平台。”他专门研究材料如何模仿大脑来提高计算能力。与大脑不同的是，大脑不断地在神经元之间形成新的连接来支持学习，计算机芯片上的电路是不会改变的。一台机器已经使用多年的电路与工厂最初为机器制造的电路没有任何不同。这是一个让人工智能更加便携的问题，比如在太空中的自动车辆或机器人，它们必须在孤立的环境中自己做出决定。如果人工智能可以直接嵌入硬件，而不是像人工智能通常那样只在软件上运行，这些机器将能够更有效地运行。在这项研究中，Ramanathan和他的团队构建了一种新的硬件，可以通过电脉冲按需重新编程。Ramanathan认为，这种适应性将使该设备能够承担建造大脑启发计算机所需的所有功能。拉马纳森说：“如果我们想制造一台受大脑启发的计算机或机器，那么相应地，我们希望有能力不断编程、重新编程和改变芯片。”以芯片形式建造大脑硬件是一个小型的长方形装置，由一种对氢非常敏感的钙钛矿镍酸盐材料制成。在不同电压下施加电脉冲，可以让该设备在纳秒内洗牌一定浓度的氢离子，产生研究人员发现可以映射到大脑相应功能的状态。例如，当该装置的中心附近有更多的氢时，它可以充当神经元，单个神经细胞。由于该位置氢气较少，该设备充当突触，神经元之间的连接，这是大脑在复杂的神经回路中用来存储记忆的东西。通过对实验数据的模拟，普渡团队在圣克拉拉大学和波特兰州立大学的合作者表明，这种设备的内部物理特性为人工神经网络创建了一个动态结构，与静态网络相比，该网络能够更有效地识别心电图模式和数字。这种神经网络使用了“储层计算”，它解释了大脑的不同部分是如何交流和传递信息的。宾夕法尼亚州立大学的研究人员在这项研究中还证明，随着新问题的出现，动态网络可以“挑选”哪些电路最适合解决这些问题。由于该团队能够使用标准的半导体兼容制造技术建造该器件，并在室温下操作该器件，Ramanathan相信这种技术可以很容易地被半导体行业采用。普渡大学材料工程专业的博士生迈克尔·帕克说：“我们证明了这种装置非常坚固。”经过一百万个循环的编程，所有功能的重新配置都是可重复的。研究人员正致力于在大规模测试芯片上演示这些概念，这些芯片将用于构建大脑启发的计算机。普渡大学的实验是在弗莱克斯实验室和普渡探索公园的伯克纳米技术中心进行的。该团队在阿贡国家实验室、伊利诺伊大学、布鲁克海文国家实验室和佐治亚大学的合作者对该设备的性能进行了测量。", "中文源标题": "大脑终身学习的秘密现在可以成为人工智能的硬件", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers at Purdue University in the United States have developed an artificial intelligence hardware that can learn for life.

When electrical pulses are applied at different voltages, the device can change the concentration of hydrogen ions within a few nanoseconds, thus creating a state that can be mapped to the corresponding functional areas of the brain. That is to say, it can dynamically receive new data like the human brain and realize the function of continuous learning over time. In addition, the chip and the brain constantly form new connections between neurons to realize the transformation of learning methods, and the circuits on the computer chip will never change.

To do this, they have been leveraging the multi-redox reactions of materials that are highly abundant on Earth, such as iron and manganese, which could help to lower battery fabrication costs.\nA team of researchers at Seoul National University has identified a-LiFeSO4F, an amorphous iron fluorisulfate electrode that could be used to develop more affordable high-capacity batteries. This electrode, presented in a paper in Nature Energy, specifically serves as a cathode (i.e., the positively charged electrode in a battery cell, through which electrons enter electronic devices).\nThe iron fluorisulfate cathode they created was inspired by a nanocomposite material that they had introduced in one of their previous works, where they also elucidated its underpinning redox mechanism and surface conversion reaction. This material is composed of nanosized lithium and a transition metal compound.\n\"Previously, we were studying the strategies for obtaining additional capacities from our nanocomposite cathode material,\" Kisuk Kang, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told TechXplore. \"As the redox mechanism of the material is similar to a conversion reaction and is typically synthesized by the high energy ball milling, we were able to attain a better understanding of the conversion reaction and mechanochemical synthesis.\"\nThe team's new study is based on the observations and findings collected in their previous research. Specifically, their past findings inspired them to explore the possibility that their nanocomposite cathode material's conversion reaction, combined with an intercalation capability, would allow them to unlock the unique capacity of the transition metal oxides within it.\n\"During the development of this concept, we pondered on how to effectively enhance the reversibility of an intercalation/conversion dual-type electrode material,\" Kang explained. \"We came to the conclusion that an amorphous structure could help to achieve this, considering the nature of the conversion reaction.\"\nThe cathode realized by Kang and his colleagues is made of LiFeSO4F, but with an amorphous (i.e., not crystalline) structure. This material could be easily synthesized using mechanochemical processes, specifically through the high-energy ball milling of lithium fluoride (LiF) and iron sulfate (FeSO4).\nA remarkable advantage of the researchers' cathode is that it supports the reversible insertion and extraction of lithium ions through two processes known as intercalation and conversion. This significantly increases its cumulative capacity, which could in turn improve a battery's life and performance.\n\"Our study unveiled the novel role of amorphous structure in enabling the reversibility of dual-type intercalation/conversion electrode material,\" Kang said. \"The reversible and simultaneous utilization of intercalation and conversion reactions in the amorphous structure is broadly applicable to other transition metal compounds and thus enlarges the candidate group of high-energy density cathode material.\"\nIn the future, the cathode introduced by this team of researchers could be used to create high-capacity and low-cost battery technologies. In addition, its underlying chemical processes might also be replicated using other transition metal compounds, which would open new possibilities for the creation of highly performing cathodes based on Earth-abundant materials.\n\"Since we verified our concept, we have been exploring a more expansive compositional space to identify other possible cathode materials,\" Kang added. \"Moreover, we are studying the general governing rules related to the synthesis of amorphous structure and the correlations between amorphization and intercalation capability.\"\n", "中文原文": "化学家和工程师一直试图创造出越来越高效、负担得起和稳定的电池技术来为广泛的电子设备供电。为了做到这一点，他们一直在利用地球上非常丰富的材料的多重氧化还原反应，如铁和锰，这可能有助于降低电池制造成本。首尔国立大学的一个研究小组已经发现了a-LiFeSO4F，一种非晶氟硫酸铁电极，可以用来开发更便宜的大容量电池。这种电极，在《自然能源》的一篇论文中提出，专门用作阴极（即电池单元中带正电荷的电极，电子通过它进入电子器件）。他们创造的氟硫酸铁阴极的灵感来自于他们在之前的一项工作中介绍的纳米复合材料，他们还阐明了其支撑氧化还原机制和表面转化反应。这种材料由纳米锂和一种过渡金属化合物组成。“以前，我们正在研究从我们的纳米复合阴极材料中获得额外容量的策略，”开展这项研究的研究人员之一Kisuk Kang告诉TechXplore。由于这种材料的氧化还原机制类似于转化反应，通常是通过高能球磨来合成的，因此我们能够更好地理解转化反应和机械力化学合成。该小组的新研究是基于他们以前研究中收集的观察和发现。特别是，他们过去的发现启发他们探索纳米复合阴极材料的转化反应，结合插层能力，将允许他们释放过渡金属氧化物在其中的独特能力的可能性。“在这个概念的发展过程中，我们思考如何有效地提高插层/转换双型电极材料的可逆性，”康解释说。“考虑到转化反应的性质，我们得出结论，非晶结构可能有助于实现这一目标。”康和他的同事实现的阴极是由LiFeSO4F制成的，但具有非晶（即，不是晶态）结构。该材料可以通过机械力化学方法，特别是通过高能球磨氟化锂（LiF）和硫酸铁(FeSO4)来合成。研究人员的阴极的一个显著优势是，它支持锂离子通过两个被称为插层和转化的过程可逆插入和提取。这大大增加了它的累积容量，进而可以提高电池的寿命和性能。康说：“我们的研究揭示了非晶结构在实现双型插层/转换电极材料可逆性方面的新作用。”非晶结构中插层和转化反应的可逆和同时利用，广泛适用于其他过渡金属化合物，从而扩大了高能量密度正极材料的候选群。在未来，这个研究小组推出的阴极可以用来创造高容量和低成本的电池技术。此外，其潜在的化学过程也可以用其他过渡金属化合物复制，这将为基于地球丰富的材料创造高性能阴极开辟新的可能性。“自从我们验证了我们的概念，我们一直在探索一个更广阔的成分空间，以识别其他可能的阴极材料，”康补充说。此外，我们正在研究与非晶结构合成有关的一般控制规则，以及非晶化与插层能力之间的相关性。", "中文源标题": "一种非晶态高容量氟硫酸铁阴极", "英文整编": "Recently, an amorphous ferric fluorosulfate electrode a-LiFeSO4F was prepared by Seoul National University in South Korea.

Ironically, it might be more complex too.\nPratt & Whitney, the aerospace engine-making division of Raytheon Technologies, is working on a 1.2 million ft.2 turbine airfoil manufacturing facility in Asheville, North Carolina, that could open sometime this year. The greenfield plant is supposed to be a “lighthouse” for manufacturing improvements across Raytheon’s brownfield sites, and it is billed as epitomizing so-called Industry 4.0 technologies, such as automation, digital twinning, 3D printing, predictive analytics and other factory of the future technologies.\nPrototype factory contains everything under one roof\nAsheville plant could be a $650 million showpiece for the company\nIn turn, the site could become home for everything from design work to casting and final assembly. About four years ago, then-United Technologies acquired a company called Mikro Systems in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fast-forward to the present day, and Mikro’s technology will allow Pratt to use a novel core manufacturing technology to create a single crystal alloy casting for use at the airfoil facility. The part will move into machining, drilling, coating and inspection cycles—all on-site. What used to entail eight handoffs and 2,500 mi. of travel for production will be reduced to zero handoffs and 1 mi. of travel.\n“The future state will include everything co-located under one roof,” Dave Parry, Pratt vice president of manufacturing and assembly, said at the Aviation Week A&D Manufacturing Conference in May. “This gives us the opportunity to rethink, ‘What does the factory of the future look like?’ Because we have to put it in action here. It’s a big investment.”\nParry, who joined Pratt four years ago after two decades in the automotive industry, said the initial challenge was defining what exactly Industry 4.0 is in real life. First, Industry 4.0 technology is increasingly digital, he noted. In the case of Pratt’s new superfactory, that process started with planning the site atop a mountain. “We started with that, then we overlay our building onto that topography and numerous different configurations and then designed all of our utilities—fire, water and electricity—digitally,” he said.\nNext was reimagining the legacy product, the airfoil, digitally. “We worked with our design engineering team to go back and 3D-model and 3D-characterize all the designs of products that [are] going to go in the factory so that we could use that digital thread in our manufacturing process,” Parry said. “Once we put all the objects in the factory of the digital twin, that allows us to then link anything we want—we can simulate the product [and] the cutting tools [or] how we would add value to the product.”\nStill, as important as the Industry 4.0 approach is to the future, it is secondary to well-honed lean manufacturing principles. Raytheon is expanding application of its Core Operating System—built on a legacy of lean and Six Sigma practices—for continuous improvement across all aspects of its business processes.\nWhat does that look like? A typical manufacturing cell starts with targeting balanced “takt time”—the rate at which workers complete a product—in component processing through integrated cell design. “Hit the button, machine runs, operator moves on to the next machine and comes back again,” Parry said. The closed-door machines have Level 1 process mistake-proofing capability, which means workers have to make sure up front that the instructions and materials are correct. Every cell has its own inspection equipment; performance analytics are digitally displayed. An Andon alert system would sound off for management awareness.\nAutomated robots move parts along the line via a harmonized 4M lean pull system—short for “material, methods, machines and man.” “The machines call for parts and the mobile robot brings the parts to the machine,” he said. “This way, we’re not loading with extra work and process in the system, building up inventory.”\nEvery worker has the ability to call for help via tablets and smartwatches. Machines also can call for maintenance themselves. The machines are designed so that tools and dies can be exchanged without stopping production.\nThe line also benefits from edge computing, or high-powered processing ability within the cell, rather than having to connect to a distant database. For cybersecurity, the factory’s information technology systems and operating technology are “one-way air-gapped,” or separated. While the separation is counterintuitive under the notion of ultraconnectivity that underpins big data analytics, it provides greater resilience against cyberthreats or problems, according to Parry.\nThe long, narrow plant’s design allows workers to drive in and park in front of their own worksite. “From the parking lot, you’re into your locker room, change into your work attire, and you’re out to your team meeting area,” Parry said. “And then from the team meet area, you go straight to your work area.” In short, workers could flow from car to worksite in roughly 15 min.\nAt the Raytheon Technologies airfoils factory (pictured under construction), the workflow of staff and machines revolves around a self-managed, nonstop line of manufacturing cells. Credit: Raytheon Technologies\nPratt has said it is investing $650 million through 2027 in the 100-acre Asheville site. Executives said last year the plant should open in the second half of 2022, after a roughly six-month delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Parry did not comment on the schedule. He showed the conference audience a photograph of the site from March that revealed significant construction machinery on the premises as well as a structure with a roof and walls but not yet enclosed.\nThe company anticipates the new manufacturing facility will create 800 jobs for North Carolina residents in Buncombe County. Given that many of Raytheon’s older employees opted for early retirement during the global pandemic, the new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility is intended to attract a younger workforce.\nAnother probable reason for the plant could be to in-source work someday and take out cost from a supplier, Howmet Aerospace. The Pratt plant will underpin an expected ramp-up in F135 production for global sales of Lockheed Martin F-35s. Howmet has been providing airfoils to Pratt for the program. Cowen analysts recently estimated that half of Howmet’s 2021 sales to Pratt, or roughly $225 million, relate to airfoils of any kind.\nDays after the Aviation Week conference, Howmet leaders hosted an investor briefing during which they received inquiries on the effects of the new Asheville plant. Managers implied that the new Pratt plant was not as much of a challenge as it first appeared, according to Cowen analysts. For starters, Howmet’s airfoils contract with Raytheon for commercial aerospace applications had been extended through 2030. Previously, Howmet executives also let it be known that their F-35-related contract was extended as well, with expiration no sooner than 2024 and possibly later.\nFurthermore, both Howmet and Raytheon expect F-35 aftermarket demand to accelerate in 2024 and beyond, which may mean there is no decline in F-35 airfoils sales for Howmet, even if contract terms change once the existing contract expires.\n“Who knows what the future is,” Howmet Executive Chairman and CEO John Plant told analysts and investors. “What I’d just tell you is we’re OK. If they make some, great.

As part of their research, they opened several cells after exposing them to different temperatures.=\nThey were stunned to see that the electrolyte solution in the cell was bright red, something they had never seen before.\nThey then began exploring the cause, placing cells with common electrolyte solution into ovens at four different temperatures. One at 25 C remained clear, while the sample at 55 C was light brown and the highest one at 70C was blood red. They did a chemical analysis and looked at the chemical composition of the electrolyte.\nThat's when they found that the polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, in the tape decomposes and creates the molecule that leads to the self-discharge. The molecule is called a redox shuttle because it can travel to the positive side of the electrode, then to the negative side and then back to the positive side. So, it shuttles between the electrodes and that creates the self-discharge, just like lithium is supposed to do. The problem is that the shuttle molecule is doing it all the time in the background, even when no lithium is supposed to move when the battery just sitting there.\n\"It's something we never expected because no one looks at these inactive components, these tapes and plastic foils in the battery cell but it really needs to be considered if you want to limit side reactions in the battery cell,\" he says of the tape made from PET, a strong, lightweight plastic used widely in packaging and pop bottles.\nCommercially relevant\nThe researchers outlined their findings in two new papers and are catching the attention of industrial heavyweights seeking ways to improve their batteries' performance. Both papers are published in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society.\nDr. Metzger recently visited a company in the States that relies on dependable, long-lasting batteries, and was asked about the tape issue after hearing about Dr. Metzger's novel discovery.\n\"The self-discharge is a super important metric for them,\" says Dr. Metzger. \"One of the engineers said, 'I heard you guys found out something is wrong with PET tape.' So, I explained to him that it's causing this self-discharge and asked him, 'What are you using in your cells?' He said, \"PET tape.'\"\nThe information could lead to a fix that might involve replacing the PET tape with a more stable material that won't degrade.\n\"It's a commercially relevant discovery.

Mike Gilday previously said Task Force 59′s success using small USVs to sense the battlespace and create a common operating picture for the U.S. Navy and its partners “has changed my thinking on the direction of unmanned.” If small USVs can do this ISR mission more cheaply, he said, “it will cause us to consider numbers and what potential payloads they’re going to have” for medium ones.\nAfter experimentation last year, including four medium and large USV prototypes participating in the Rim of the Pacific exercise in Hawaii, Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, who leads surface warfare on the CNO’s staff, said “we are very excited about the prospects of what MUSV can bring.”\nThrough USV Division One within the Surface Development Squadron, Pyle explained, “we are doing a lot of storming and norming in this space of what the [command and control] looks like, how we do the operational employment, and what the future of the medium unmanned platform is.”\nHe told Defense News on Jan. 11 at the annual Surface Navy Association conference that the MUSV conducting cyber, surveillance and targeting missions proved “advantageous.”\n“We’ve learned a lot from recent events such as RIMPAC, and we’re going to continue to take opportunities of exercises and fleet experimentation to determine what’s the best capability to go in there to support distributed maritime operations,” he added.\nThe Navy intends to begin the LUSV program in fiscal 2025, but has not publicly discussed potential timing of an MUSV program — particularly amid the conversation about whether the service wants a medium versus a small USV for the ISR mission set.\n“We have investments in medium unmanned surface vessels and we are moving out on it. The [Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants] and I are lockstep, and we’ve got very good dialogue with the fleet on what we want to accomplish with this platform,” Pyle said during a panel discussion about moving these vessels from experimentation into fleet operations.\nThe head of USV Division One, Cmdr. Jeremiah Daley, told Defense News on Jan. 12 at the conference that, whereas USV operations at RIMPAC and previous advanced-phase predeployment training focused on a single destroyer paired with one drone, this year will host more complex and realistic scenarios.\nPlanned events with the soon-to-be five total USVs in his division will “increase the scope and complexity of those events, integrated both with individual ships, with Marine Corps and with carrier strike groups,” he said.\n“We’re now tying directly into surface action group and carrier strike group operations” as they simultaneously conduct multiple kinds of operations and rely on USV payloads to sense and affect the battlespace.\nAsked about the Navy’s comfort in operating unmanned craft alongside crewed ships, Daley replied: “Our command is comfortable, but the real customer is the fleet. The more frequently we engage the fleet directly, with their operations and their missions and their exercises and their training objectives, the more comfortable the fleet will be with normalizing USV operations with the larger fleet. That’s what our goal is this year.”\nAll seven of the planned prototypes — the Sea Hunter and Sea Hawk medium USVs, four Overlord large USVs, and another medium USV prototype on contract with L3Harris Technologies — are technically medium USVs due to their length. The Large USV program of record will involve a longer hull that can store and launch missiles, acting as an adjunct magazine for the surface fleet.\nDespite the smaller size of these prototypes and their current use of non-kinetic payloads, Daley said his division’s work is reducing risk for the LUSV program, not just informing the path forward for the MUSV program.\nThe most recently delivered prototype, the Mariner, has the USV version of the integrated combat system and will help sailors and Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems learn more about this capability before the LUSV is designed and delivered.\nDaley also said his division is working on the development of tactics and concepts of operations, some of which would apply to both large and medium USVs.\nGilday said Jan. 10 at the conference that he expects the first USV to deploy with a carrier strike group in 2027 to demonstrate “meaningful” manned-unmanned teaming.\n", "中文原文": "弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿。-美国海军在此前质疑该系统的必要性或实用性后，正在加强中型无人水面舰艇的计划。领导人说，海军有七艘大型和中型USV原型在其监管或合同中，这些船只已经显示出在与情报、监视、侦察和目标相关的有效载荷周围有一个无人驾驶手提箱的价值。与此同时，作为第59特遣部队一部分的小型USV正在执行自己的ISR任务，由于它们的规模和低成本，数量要大得多。海军已经宣布了对一个大型USV计划的承诺。海军作战部长迈克·吉尔戴上将此前表示，特遣部队59成功地使用小型USV来感知战场空间，并为美国海军及其合作伙伴创建一个共同的作战画面，“改变了我对无人驾驶方向的想法”。他说，如果小型USV能够更便宜地完成这项ISR任务，“这将使我们考虑中型USV的数量以及它们将拥有什么样的潜在有效载荷”。在去年的实验后，包括参加夏威夷环太平洋演习的四架中型和大型USV原型，领导CNO工作人员水面作战的弗雷德·派尔少将说，“我们对MUSV能带来的前景感到非常兴奋。”派尔解释说，通过水面开发中队的USV第一师，“我们正在这个空间进行大量的突击和规范，包括（指挥和控制）是什么样子，我们如何进行作战雇佣，以及中型无人平台的未来是什么。”1月11日，他在年度水面海军协会会议上告诉《国防新闻》，执行网络、监视和目标任务的MUSV被证明是“有利的”。他补充说：“我们从最近的事件中学到了很多，如RIMPAC，我们将继续利用演习和舰队实验的机会，以确定什么是支持分布式海上行动的最佳能力。”海军打算在2025财年开始LUSV计划，但没有公开讨论MUSV计划的潜在时间--尤其是在关于该服务是否想要中型还是小型USV用于ISR任务集的对话中。“我们在中型无人水面舰艇上有投资，我们正在着手进行。派尔在一次关于将这些船只从试验转移到舰队行动的小组讨论中说：“（项目执行办公室无人驾驶和小型战斗人员）和我步调一致，我们与舰队就我们想用这个平台完成什么进行了非常好的对话。”USV第一分部的负责人Jeremiah Daley上校1月12日在会议上告诉《国防新闻》，尽管RIMPAC的USV行动和以前的高级阶段部署前训练侧重于一艘驱逐舰和一架无人机，但今年将面临更复杂和现实的场景。他说，他所在的师即将有五艘USV参加的计划活动将“增加这些活动的范围和复杂性，与单个船只、海军陆战队和航母打击群结合在一起”。“我们现在直接进入水面行动群和航母战斗群行动”，因为它们同时进行多种行动，并依赖USV有效载荷来感知和影响战场空间。当被问及海军在载人船只旁边操作无人驾驶飞机的舒适性时，戴利回答说：“我们的指挥是舒适的，但真正的客户是舰队。我们越频繁地与舰队直接接触，与他们的行动、任务、演习和训练目标接触，舰队就越容易与更大的舰队进行常态化的USV行动。这就是我们今年的目标。“所有七款计划中的原型--海猎人和海鹰中型USV、四款霸王大型USV，以及另一款与L3Harris Technologies签订合同的中型USV原型--由于其长度，从技术上来说都是中型USV。记录的大型USV计划将包括一个更长的船体，可以储存和发射导弹，作为水面舰队的附属弹匣。尽管这些原型体积较小，目前使用的是非动力有效载荷，戴利说，他的部门的工作是降低LUSV计划的风险，而不仅仅是为MUSV计划指明前进的道路。最近交付的原型水手号拥有综合作战系统的USV版本，将帮助水手和计划执行办公室综合作战系统在LUSV设计和交付之前了解更多关于这种能力的信息。戴利还表示，他的部门正在开发战术和作战概念，其中一些将适用于大型和中型USV。吉尔达1月10日在会议上说，他预计第一艘USV将于2027年与航母战斗群一起部署，以展示“有意义的”有人驾驶-unma", "中文源标题": "美国海军在测试后更加确定中型水面无人机的作用", "英文整编": "Recently, the U.S. Navy is advancing the \"Medium Unmanned Surface Ship\" (MUSV) program.

After an extensive buildup, the People’s Liberation Army just invaded Taiwan. Chinese forces have captured airfields and ports, and Beijing’s forces are streaming endlessly into the interior of the island. U.S. forces, particularly transport planes, cannot get close enough to the island to resupply the Taiwanese military. The newly allied forces need something to break the steel ring of Chinese air and naval power isolating the island.\nMeanwhile, a strange buildup is taking place across the Western Pacific. American C-17 Globemaster III transports, Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Super Hercules, Japanese C-2 transports, and even commercial C-130s are congregating at remote airbases. Each is loaded with strange green pallets rigged with parachutes. On D+31 of the invasion, the transports rise up as one—hundreds of planes winging their way toward Taiwan. Still hundreds of miles away from the island, they lower their ramps and their pallet cargoes slide out, free-falling towardd the Pacific Ocean below.\nAs the pallets fall, they trigger parachutes, slowing their descent. Individual land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles begin falling out, spinning up their turbine engines and activating their internal navigation systems. Scores, then hundreds of missiles begin streaming toward Chinese ships, air defenses, command centers, supply depots, and other high-value targets. Behind this wall of AI-guided missiles is a U.S. Navy carrier battle group, dry cargo ships brimming with supplies, and an embarked U.S. Marine Corps brigade. The calvary is coming to Taiwan’s rescue at last.\nThis could be the future of missile warfare. On November 9, U.S. special operations forces off the coast of Norway conducted a live-fire demonstration of Rapid Dragon, an innovative new system that will allow air forces to use transport planes as missile-slinging bombers.\n“When you look at partner capability, we have a lot of partners around the globe that don’t have heavy bomber-type platforms that would be traditional carriers of those types of munitions, but they’ve got plenty of C-130s proliferated around the world,” Lt. Gen. Jim Slife, AFSOC commander, says in an Air Force press release.\nTraditionally, the world of big, strategic bombers has had a high barrier to entry. Most countries have never built them, most can’t afford them, and only three countries have any plans to build them today: the United States, China, and Russia. Yet there are many air forces that would, for one reason or another, like to have the capability.\nBombers require large airplanes with large internal volume and long ranges. Even stealth, or the ability to slip past enemy radar, is optional. Instead, a bomber can always carry large numbers of long-range cruise missiles meant to penetrate enemy defenses, just like Russia’s Tupolev Tu-95 “Bear” bomber . The twin virtues of capacity and range allow the 1950s-era Tu-95, with its contra-rotating propellers and giant radar signature, to remain relevant on the modern battlefield.\nPlenty of air forces (even modest ones), it turns out, have planes that satisfy many of the requirements of cruise-missile bombers: cargo planes.\nDeveloped by the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation office, Rapid Dragon stacks air-launched cruise missiles like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munition (JASSM) or the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) on air-droppable pallets. In the event of war, as the above scenario describes, the aircraft can drop the pallet like any other parachutable cargo, except this is a cargo with live missiles that slide out and self-launch. A C-130J Super Hercules can carry six missiles, and a larger C-17 Globemaster III can carry nine ... so far. When dozens of aircraft are involved, the number of missiles launched on a single mission can reach into the hundreds.\nAfter dropping their pallet cargoes, the cargo planes can fly home and prepare for further bombing missions or revert to their traditional roles as cargo haulers. Rapid Dragon requires no modifications of the transporting aircraft to take on the deadly new role: once the pallets are embarked, just like any other air-dropped pallet, the plane is a deputized bomber.\nRapid Dragon expresses the military concept of “mass” on the battlefield. Mass is the concentration of combat power at a specific point for a specific purpose. One-hundred tanks spread across 100 miles of battlefield can individually dominate their surroundings, but 100 tanks spread across a mile can dominate a single point in the enemy’s defenses and punch through. In this case, Rapid Dragon allows the Air Force to use its vast arsenal of cruise missiles on a massive, overwhelming strike, and not dozens of smaller, less effective strikes.\nThe Rapid Dragon test took place less than 600 miles from Russia’s Northern Fleet headquarters at Murmansk. While the official Pentagon line is that the test is “not signaling at Russia or any other adversary,” the Northern Fleet is one of the few untouched military resources available to Russia outside of its devastating war in Ukraine. Regardless of what the Pentagon says, Russia will almost certainly interpret it as a signal—and an unfriendly one at that.\n", "中文原文": "这可能是导弹战争的未来。美国空军即将测试其快速龙导弹发射概念。它包括托盘式巡航导弹推出任何带有货物坡道的飞机后部。快速龙可以让五角大楼在战时增派大量携带巡航导弹的飞机。飞龙假设现在是2035年。在大规模集结之后，人民解放军刚刚入侵台湾。中国军队已经占领了机场和港口，北京的军队正在无休止地涌入该岛内陆。美国军队，尤其是运输机，无法足够接近该岛，为台湾军队提供补给。新盟军需要一些东西来打破中国空军和海军力量孤立该岛的钢圈。与此同时，一个奇怪的集结正在西太平洋发生。美国C-17 Globemaster III运输机，澳大利亚皇家空军C-130J超级大力士，日本C-2运输机，甚至商用C-130都聚集在偏远的空军基地。每一个都装载着奇怪的绿色托盘，托盘上装有降落伞。在入侵的D+31日，运输机升起，数百架飞机向台湾飞去。离岛还有数百英里，他们放下斜坡，托盘货物滑出，自由下落，漂浮在下面的太平洋上。当托盘下落时，它们触发降落伞，减缓它们的下降速度。单独的对地攻击和反舰巡航导弹开始脱落，旋转涡轮发动机并激活内部导航系统。然后数百枚导弹开始流向中国船只、防空系统、指挥中心、补给站和其他高价值目标。在这堵人工智能导弹墙后面是一个美国海军航母战斗群、装满补给品的干货船和一个上岸的美国海军陆战队旅。加略山终于来拯救台湾了。这可能是导弹战争的未来。11月9日，美国特种作战部队在挪威海岸进行了快速龙的实弹演示，这是一种创新的新系统，将允许空军使用运输机作为导弹投掷轰炸机。AFSOC指挥官吉姆·斯利夫中将在一份空军新闻稿中说：“当你看到合作伙伴的能力时，我们在全球有许多合作伙伴没有重型轰炸机型平台，这将是这些类型弹药的传统载体，但他们有大量C-130在世界各地扩散。”传统上，大型战略轰炸机的世界有很高的准入门槛。大多数国家从来没有建造过它们，大多数国家负担不起，只有三个国家今天有建造它们的计划：美国、中国和俄罗斯。然而，出于这样或那样的原因，有许多空军希望拥有这种能力。轰炸机需要内部体积大、航程远的大型飞机。即使是隐身，或者滑过敌人雷达的能力，也是可选的。相反，轰炸机总是可以携带大量远程巡航导弹来穿透敌人的防御，就像俄罗斯的图波列夫图-95“熊”轰炸机一样。容量和航程的双重优点使20世纪50年代的图-95凭借其反向旋转螺旋桨和巨大的雷达特征，在现代战场上保持相关性。事实证明，许多空军（即使是规模不大的空军）都有满足巡航导弹轰炸机许多要求的飞机：货机。由空军研究实验室的战略发展规划和实验办公室开发的快速龙将空中发射的巡航导弹，如联合空对地对峙弹药(JASSM)或远程反舰导弹(LRASM)堆放在可空投的托盘上。在战争的情况下，正如上面的场景描述的那样，飞机可以像任何其他跳伞货物一样扔下托盘，除了这是一个带有滑出并自动发射的实弹的货物。一架C-130J超级大力士可以携带6枚导弹，一架更大的C-17环球霸王III可以携带9枚……到目前为止。当有几十架飞机参与时，一次任务发射的导弹数量可以达到数百枚。在放下托盘货物后，货机可以飞回家，为进一步的轰炸任务做准备，或者恢复他们作为货物运输者的传统角色。快速龙不需要对运输飞机进行任何修改来承担致命的新角色：一旦托盘被装载，就像任何其他空投托盘一样，飞机是一架代理轰炸机。《疾速龙》表达了战场上“大众”的军事理念。质量是为了特定目的，在特定点上的战斗力的集中。100辆坦克散布在100英里的战场上可以单独控制周围的环境，但100辆坦克散布在一英里的战场上可以控制敌人防御的一个点并突围而出。在这种情况下，快速龙", "中文源标题": "空军如何把一架C-130货机变成一架投掷导弹的轰炸机", "英文整编": "On November 9th, the US Air Force conducted the first live-fire exercise of the concept of \"Rapid Dragon\" missile launch off the Norwegian coast, which showed that the concept had entered practice from theory.

Beyond that, the radio includes a receiving sensitivity of -97.5 dBm at 1 Mbps GFSK (Gaussian frequency-shift keying) while requiring 4 mA of RX current.\nSabolcik notes, “It's easy to build those types of high-performance radios if you don't care about power. But this device has been designed to be able to operate off of batteries. So we do it with really low current consumption.”\nFinally, from a sensing perspective, Silicon Labs has put a 20-bit ADC on their SoC. Silicon Labs tells us that this high-resolution ADC offers the high precision needed in fields like medical and industrial IoT.\nSilicon Labs Keeps a Sharp Focus on Security\nBringing AI/ML to the edge, Silicon Labs envisions these devices finding use in basic smart home applications—like gateways and hubs, smart plugs, door locks, and switches—while also offering more complex utility, like wake-word detection, broken glass detection, and predictive maintenance. The two new families are also purpose-built for portable medical devices like pulse oximeters and blood glucose meters.\nInvolving IoT devices in health and home calls for a high standard of security—and Silicon Labs has also addressed this important consideration into the SoCs' design. Both chips employ Silicon Labs' Secure Vault technology, which protects devices against both remote and local software attacks and local hardware attacks. Secure Vault accomplishes this with a number of features, including a physically unclonable function (PUF), secure boot with RTSL, secure debug unlock, anti-tamper, DPA countermeasures, and a true random number generator (TRNG), among others.\nA Supportive Software Toolkit for AI/ML Deployment\nIn addition to the two new SoCs, Silicon Labs is also releasing a software toolkit to help designers efficiently build and deploy AI/ML algorithms. This toolkit natively supports TensorFlow and can be used with Silicon Labs' Simplicity Studio platform to create new applications and draw data from numerous connected devices that use the BG24 and MG24 families of SoCs. Using the Matter protocol, these devices can communicate with one another to make ML-based decisions. \nConsumers demand that their IoT devices balance a unique combination of performance, low power, and connectivity. While this is a difficult trio to blend, Silicon Labs hopes to accomplish this feat with its two new families of wireless SoCs. \n“The big challenge with doing AI/ML at the edge is typically twofold. It's either power or bandwidth. If you have a Wi-Fi link and you've got tens of megabytes per second worth of bandwidth (or hundreds of megabytes), you can push a lot of data to the cloud and run learning algorithms there,” Sabolcik explains. “But if you're on a device that doesn't have a lot of power and doesn't have a lot of bandwidth, the ability to make detections [using the BG24 and MG24] at the device is pretty powerful.”\n", "中文原文": "Silicon Labs表示，有了这两个新系列，电池供电的边缘设备将不会面临功耗、协议支持、ML能力和安全性的权衡。今天，Silicon Labs发布了两个针对低功耗物联网边缘处理的无线SoC新家族。BG24和MG24无线SOC包括一个集成的AI/ML加速器，用于电池供电的边缘设备，同时支持广泛的协议:Matter、Bluetooth Low Energy、Bluetooth mesh、OpenThread、Zigbee、专有和多协议操作。该公司还发布了一个附带的软件平台，帮助开发人员为许多用例部署这些AI/ML算法。《关于电路的一切》有机会与Silicon Labs负责工业和商业物联网产品的副总裁罗斯·萨博尔奇克（Ross Sabolcik）交谈，以直接了解新的SoCs。计算、连接和感知根据Sabolcik的说法，这些SOC将成为公司的旗舰物联网产品，并在系统的每个方面提供公司最好的指标。他说：“这将我们最好的技术全面部署在一个设备上：计算、连接和传感。”Silicon Labs专注于这三个领域--计算、连接和传感--声称MG24和BG24 SOC是业界首款包含专用AI/ML加速器的超低功耗设备。在内部测试中，Silicon Labs发现，其新加速器允许SoC在AI/ML应用中实现4倍的功耗降低和6倍的速度提升。这一性能飞跃对器件的功率效率有相关影响。Sabolcik解释说：“你计算得越快，设备就越少，睡觉时就能节省更多的电池。”“对于这些SOC，AI/ML内核一直是其中非常重要的一部分。”这两个SOC都是围绕一个78 MHz的Arm Cortex M33构建的，它由256 kB的RAM和1526 kB的flash支持。在连接性方面，这两款SOC都支持2.4GHz无线通信。MG24和BG24的主要区别在于前者支持BLE和Bluetooth Mesh，而后者支持Matter、OpenThread和Zigbee。除了这一差异，这两种SOC都具有硅实验室有史以来生产的最高性能的收音机。新的无线电子系统具有20 dBm的发射功率，同时消耗155 mA TX电流，产生更长的通信范围或改进的链路预算。除此之外，该收音机在1 Mbps GFSK（高斯频移键控）下的接收灵敏度为-97.5dBm，同时需要4毫安的RX电流。Sabolcik指出，“如果你不关心功率，很容易制造这些类型的高性能收音机。但这种设备被设计成能够不用电池工作。所以我们用非常低的电流消耗来做。“最后，从传感角度来看，Silicon Labs在SoC上安装了一个20位ADC。Silicon Labs告诉我们，这种高分辨率ADC提供了医疗和工业物联网等领域所需的高精度。Silicon Labs高度关注安全性Silicon Labs将AI/ML推向了边缘，设想这些设备在基本的智能家居应用中找到用途--如网关和集线器、智能插头、门锁和开关--同时还提供更复杂的实用功能，如唤醒词检测、碎玻璃检测和预测性维护。这两个新系列也是为便携式医疗设备如脉搏血氧仪和血糖仪专门设计的。将物联网设备应用于健康和家庭需要高标准的安全--硅实验室也将这一重要考虑纳入了SOC的设计中。这两款芯片都采用了Silicon Labs的安全金库技术，可以保护设备免受远程和本地软件攻击以及本地硬件攻击。Secure Vault通过许多功能实现了这一点，包括物理不可克隆函数(PUF)、使用RTSL的安全引导、安全调试解锁、防篡改、DPA对策和真正的随机数生成器(TRNG)等。支持AI/ML部署的软件工具包除了这两款新的SOC，Silicon Labs还发布了一款软件工具包，帮助设计人员高效地构建和部署AI/ML算法。此工具包本机支持TensorFlow并可与Silicon Labs的Simpliance Studio平台一起使用，以创建新的应用程序，并从使用BG24和MG24系列SOC的众多连接设备中提取数据。使用Matter协议，这些设备可以相互通信以做出基于ML的决策。消费者要求他们的物联网设备平衡性能、低功耗和连接性的独特组合。虽然这是一个很难融合的三重奏，硅实验室希望通过其两个新的无线SOC家族来完成这一壮举。“在边缘做AI/ML的最大挑战通常是双重的。不是功率就是带宽。如果你有一个Wi-Fi链接，你有几十个梅格", "中文源标题": "Silicon Labs在低功耗无线SoCs中集成AI/ML加速", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers in American Silicon Laboratory developed two low-power wireless system-on-chip (SoC) BG24 and MG24.

Through testing, it is found that the new accelerators reduce the power consumption of SOC by 4 times and increase the speed by 6 times in AI/ML applications. In terms of connection, both SOC support 2. 4 GHz wireless communication. In addition, they also released a software platform that can help researchers deploy AI/ML algorithms for many applications.

The company sees doing so as vital to broadening access to space exploration from just a handful of governments and firms to wider research groups, and through “pushing the boundaries of today’s technology,” it says it’s possible to “open space for all.”\nPrimarily, Skyroot Aerospace’s efforts to achieve this have revolved around its Vikram launch vehicles. Named after Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, founder of the Indian Space Program, the modular rockets are built specifically to cater for the satellite launch market.\nNumbered Vikram I to III, the firm’s rockets are each capable launching 480-815 kilograms into LEO, thanks to their fully-3D printed cryogenic engine. Unveiled in late-2020, Skyroot Aerospace’s propulsion system is cryogenic in that it’s fuelled by a liquid natural gas cryo-propellant, and it’s reported to have been created entirely from high-strength carbon fiber using powder bed fusion (PBF).\nDesigned to propel the upper-stage of the firm’s rockets, the engine is said to be capable of multiple restarts, potentially enabling it to drop satellites into several orbits on a single mission. With Skyroot Aerospace estimating that 20,000 small satellites will be launched to LEO over the coming decade, it now aims to address this market itself via its own launch service, with the Vikram at the heart of it.\nScaling up for a commercial launch\nSaid to be the largest funding round of any Indian space firm to date, Skyroot Aerospace’s backing provides it with the cash needed to go from rocket testing to establishing commercial launch capabilities. The funding round’s main backer, GIC, doesn’t list its full portfolio in its reports, but it positions itself as an investor in tech firms, making it a useful long-term backer for a business still building its offering.\nThat said, Skyroot Aerospace continues to make progress in the R&D of its Vikram rockets, with the Vikram-I successfully passing third-stage testing in May 2022. During the test, which was carried out at the facilities of one of the company’s other investors,Solar Industries India, the launch vehicle is reported to have generated a peak vacuum thrust of 100 kN and achieved a burn time of around 108 seconds.\nMoving forwards, using its newly-raised capital, Skyroot Aerospace expects to be able to complete initial flight testing, in addition to expanding its engineering team and infrastructure in preparation for the launch of its services next year.\n“We have validated all three propulsion technologies in our Vikram space launch vehicles, and completed a full duration test of one of our rocket stages in May ’22,” added Skyroot COO Naga Bharath Daka. “We are also planning a demonstrator launch to space this year. This round will help us get to full-fledged commercial satellite launch scale within a year from now. We have started booking payload slots for our upcoming launches.”\n3D printing as a spaceflight enabler\nCryogenic rocket propulsion systems i.e. those fuelled by gasses that have been liquified and stored at cold temperatures, are hardly new in the world of spaceflight. In fact,Pratt & Whitney’sRL10 was first flown in 1963, but it’s still the most-used upper-stage engine in the US, withAerojet Rocketdynenow contracted to build it.\nAs you’d expect with an engine developed 59 years ago, its latest manufacturing custodian continually iterates on its design with the aim of improving its performance. As long ago as 2017, the firmhot-fire tested a 3D printed RL10 thrust chamber, and it has since received anorder for 116 part-3D printed RL10C-X enginesfromUnited Launch Alliance.\nElsewhere in the 3D printing industry, the technology has also been deployed extensively in the creation of launch-ready rocket propulsion systems.Rocket Lab’s 3D printed Rutherford engine, for example, continues to be used to propel the Electron into LEO, a rocket that’s now completed 29 launches and fired 149 satellites into orbit.\nMore recently,X-Bow Systems has tested its Bolt rocket, as part of a mission that saw it carry a test payload forLos Alamos National Lab. The Bolt is powered byBallesta 3D printed rocket engines, which are fuelled by propellant grains with flexible geometries that can be tailored to meet application-specific requirements.\n", "中文原文": "印度太空初创公司upSkyroot航空航天公司筹集了5100万美元用于开发其3D打印低温发动机动力火箭。天空根航空航天公司的维克拉姆运载火箭能够携带高达815公斤的重量进入低地球轨道(LEO)，由达万-1推动，这是一种由高温合金打印的3D发动机，以一种将其生产时间缩短95%的方式。通过新加坡investorGIC牵头的一轮融资获得了B系列支持，该公司现在有资金为其首次发射测试提供资金，并建立自己的卫星发射服务。Skyroot Aerospace首席执行官帕万·库马尔·钱达纳（Pawan Kumar Chandana）表示：“这一轮通过资助我们所有的初始开发发射，使我们走上了高速增长的轨道，并使基础设施建设能够满足我们卫星客户要求的高发射节奏。”“我们的目标是使自己成为一流火箭发射服务的提供者，并成为负担得起和可靠的小型卫星发射的目的地。”“我们很荣幸欢迎世界领先的机构投资者成为我们‘开放空间’的长期合作伙伴。”使太空探索民主化天根航空航天公司成立于2018年，旨在降低地球到太空的运输成本。该公司认为，这样做对于将太空探索的机会从少数政府和公司扩大到更广泛的研究团体至关重要，并通过“推动当今技术的边界”，它说有可能“为所有人开放空间”。首先，Skyroot航空航天公司为实现这一目标所做的努力围绕着其维克拉姆运载火箭。以印度太空计划创始人维克拉姆·萨拉巴伊博士的名字命名的模块化火箭是专门为满足卫星发射市场而建造的。该公司的火箭编号为维克拉姆I至III，由于其完全3D打印的低温发动机，每个火箭都能向低地轨道发射480-815公斤。天根航空航天公司的推进系统于2020年底公布，是低温的，因为它由液态天然气低温推进剂提供燃料，据报道，它完全由使用粉末床聚变(PBF)的高强度碳纤维制造。该发动机旨在推动该公司火箭的上层，据说能够多次重启，潜在地使其能够在一次任务中将卫星送入几个轨道。天空根航空航天公司估计，未来十年将向低地轨道发射2万颗小型卫星，它现在的目标是通过自己的发射服务来解决这一市场，维克拉姆是其核心。扩大商业发射规模据说是迄今为止印度航天公司中最大的一轮融资，天空根航空航天公司的支持为其提供了从火箭测试到建立商业发射能力所需的现金。融资轮的主要支持者GIC没有在报告中列出其全部投资组合，但它将自己定位为科技公司的投资者，这使其成为仍在开发产品的企业的有用长期支持者。也就是说，天空根航空航天公司在维克拉姆火箭的研发方面继续取得进展，维克拉姆-I号于2022年5月成功通过第三阶段测试。在该公司的另一个投资者印度太阳能工业公司的设施中进行的测试中，据报道，运载火箭产生了100千牛的峰值真空推力，燃烧时间约为108秒。展望未来，利用新筹集的资金，Skyroot Aerospace预计将能够完成初始飞行测试，此外还将扩大其工程团队和基础设施，为明年推出服务做准备。Skyroot首席运营官纳加·巴拉特·达卡补充说：“我们已经验证了维克拉姆航天运载火箭的所有三种推进技术，并于5月22日完成了一个火箭级的全程测试。”“我们还计划今年向太空发射演示器。这一轮将帮助我们在一年内达到成熟的商业卫星发射规模。我们已经开始为即将到来的发射预订有效载荷插槽。“3D打印技术在航天中的应用低温火箭推进系统，即那些以液体化并储存在低温下的气体为燃料的系统，在航天世界中并不新鲜。事实上，普惠公司的sRL10于1963年首次飞行，但它仍然是美国使用最多的上层发动机，由Aerojet Rocketdynenow承包建造。正如你对59年前开发的发动机所期望的那样，它的最新制造保管人不断迭代其设计，以提高其性能。早在2017年，firmhot-fire就测试了一个3D打印的RL10推力室，此后它收到了联合发射联盟116台部分3D打印的RL10C-X发动机的订单。在3D打印行业的其他地方，这项技术也被广泛应用于发射准备火箭推进系统的创建", "中文源标题": "Skyroot Aerospace筹集5100万美元用于推进维克拉姆火箭3D打印低温发动机的研发", "英文整编": "Skyroot Aerospace, an Indian company, has raised $51 million for research and development of 3D printing of cryogenic rocket engines.

In May 2022, Vikram-I successfully passed the third level test. After testing, the peak vacuum thrust of the launch vehicle is as high as 100 kN, and the combustion time lasts about 108 seconds. In addition, Skyroot Aerospace has verified three propulsion technologies through Vikram rocket, and completed the whole test in May 22. This year, a space demonstrator will be launched, which will enable it to reach a mature commercial satellite launch scale within one year. In the future, Skyroot Aerospace is expected to complete preliminary flight tests and will expand its engineering team and infrastructure to prepare for the launch of new business next year.In other areas of the 3D printing industry, this technology is also widely used to create rocket propulsion systems. For example, Rocket Lab's 3D printed Rutherford engine will continue to be used to push the \"Electronic\" rocket into LEO, which has completed 29 launches and put 149 satellites into orbit."}, {"中文标题": "雷声技术公司下一代中频干扰机已经做好生产准备", "情报来源": "防务世界网站", "时间": "2021年7月5日", "整编内容": "在完成里程碑C评估后，美海军授予雷声技术公司1.72亿美元，开始低速初始生产下一代中频带干扰机。\n本合同采购了三套下一代中频干扰机低速初始生产第一批次成套设备、相关备件、用于操作测试程序集开发的关键单元体以及相关技术数据，相关工作预计于2023年10月完成。\n海军计划为其EA-18G“咆哮者”电子战飞机部署低频、中频和高频干扰机。下一代中频干扰机将取代目前在EA-18G上使用的ALQ-99战术干扰系统。\n该中频干扰机由软件控制，使用有源电子扫描阵列，相较于机械扫描阵列可更快、更精确的发送无线电波，旨在通过攻击使用中频无线电频率的系统，对防空和通信系统进行电子攻击。\n美军在过去的战争中用雷达干扰等电子战攻击方式暂时蒙蔽、挫败和迷惑对手，以此制造攻击敌人的机会。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "中国航空发动机研究院", "源网址": "https://www.defenseworld.net/news/29957/Raytheon___s_Next_Generation_Jammer_Mid_Band_Ready_for_Production", "源标题": "Raytheon’s Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band Ready for Production", "原文": "The U.S. Navy awarded Raytheon $172 million to start low-rate initial production of the Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band, after finishing the Milestone C assessment for the programme.\nThis contract procures three Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band low rate initial production Lot One ship sets, associated spares, gold units for operational test program set development and associated technical data.\nWork is expected to be completed in October 2023.\nThe Navy plans to field three jammers on its Boeing EA-18G Growler electronic attack aircraft: low-, mid- and high-band.

Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., in announcing a proposed bill to \"remedy that.\" ", "原文": "By Theresa Hitchens on May 13, 2022 at 1:29 PM\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nCORRECTION: This story was updated 5/14/22 at 2:45 pm EST with a new headline and lead paragraph. The original version of both indicated Raymond directly commented on the Space Guard proposal, which he did not.\nWASHINGTON: With new legislation introduced to force the creation of a Space National Guard program, the question of the newest military service’s structure is once again in the spotlight.\nOn May 3, Gen. Jay Raymond, the Space Force head, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that a Space Guard setup could be done two ways: “Either have a separate Space National Guard or take the capabilities from the Guard and move them into” a single component concept.\nSpeaking May 13 in front of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, Raymond elaborated, saying that working out the service structure is a top priority for him.\n“Over the past two years, we have overhauled how we recruit, assess, train, develop, promote and employ and take care of Guardians. Resilient space power isn’t just about satellites. It’s also about Guardians. This is one of the reason why we are seeking the integration of active duty and reserve forces into a single hybrid component structure,” he told the House Appropriations defense subcommittee.\nRaymond’s remarks came on the heels of the May 11 move by 12 senators with Air National Guard space units in their states to — led by the rare pairing of California Democrat Diane Feinstein and Florida Republican Marco Rubio — to propose legislation designed to create a separate Space Guard. It was co-sponsored by Senators John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Michael Bennet D-Colo., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Rick Scott, R-Fla., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Mike Braun, R-Ind. and John Cornyn, R-Texas.\n“Without a National Guard component for Space Force, we risk losing many talented individuals who want to keep serving their country and their states after they leave active duty, and that is simply unacceptable,” Feinstein said in the announcement of the legislation. “Creating a Space Force National Guard would also save money and ensure a smoother process in the event we need to activate personnel. Not establishing a Space National Guard was a mistake when Space Force was created, and this bill will remedy that.”\nThe issue has been simmering ever since the creation of the Space Force in December 2019, with National Guard leadership vocally making the case for a new branch. Indeed, in early 2020 top Guard adjutants general broke with the Pentagon to speak out in favor of a separate Space Guard, and began a congressional lobbying campaign.\nThus, it comes as no surprise that the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), representing some 45,000 current and former guardsmen, on Thursday came out in support of the Feinstein-Rubio bill.\n“Approximately 1,000 space professionals are in 16 Air National Guard units across eight states and territories. They provide 60% of the military’s space electronic warfare capability, the only mobile, survivable missile-warning capability and 100% of the surge capacity,” the NGAUS press release said.\nBut those highly qualified people have essentially been “orphaned” within the Air Force for the past two years, NGAUS head J. Roy Robinson said in the release. “This complicates acquiring needed resources and professional development,” he said.\nSpeaking in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces subcommittee on May 11, Raymond’s second in command, Gen. DT Thompson, said that the service hopes to finish a study on how best to integrate the current members of the Air National Guard into the space service in time for the 2024 budget drop.\nThompson reminded lawmakers that the Biden administration last year formally rejected the concept, and reiterated the importance of making a path for current Air National Guard members who wish to affiliate with the Space Force.\n“We cannot do without the capability and missions that they provide today moving into the future,” Thompson said.\nHowever, he responded to arguments by Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. in favor of a separate Space Guard by explaining that the ongoing Space Force study also is looking at how to replace any current space-focused guards who might not wish to relocate to join the new Space Component.\n“We are making no assumptions about whether those members would accept or desire that transfer, or not. We are certainly, as part of our assessment, determining what would be required to replace those members by Space Force members — the numbers it would take, the training time it would take, the training resources that would take, and the corresponding degradation in mission as we bring those those units back up to full status,” Thompson said.\n", "中文原文": "特里萨·希钦斯于2022年5月13日下午1点29分参议员黛安娜·范斯坦（D-CA）在参议院司法委员会确认听证会上发言。（安娜·货币制造者/盖蒂影像公司）更正：这个故事在美国东部时间5/14/22下午2:45更新，有一个新的标题和导语。两者的原始版本都表明雷蒙德直接评论了太空警卫队的提议，但他没有。华盛顿：随着新的立法出台，强制建立太空国民警卫队计划，最新兵役的结构问题再次成为焦点。5月3日，太空部队负责人杰伊·雷蒙德将军（Jay Raymond）在参议院军事委员会（Senate Armed Services Committee）听证会上表示，太空警卫队的设置可以通过两种方式进行：“要么有一个单独的太空国民警卫队，要么从警卫队那里获得能力，并将其转移到”一个单一的组成部分概念中。雷蒙德5月13日在众议院拨款防御小组委员会面前详细阐述了这一点，他说制定服务结构是他的首要任务。“在过去的两年里，我们彻底改革了招聘、评估、培训、发展、晋升、雇用和照顾监护人的方式。弹性空间力量不仅仅是卫星。也是关于守护者的。这是我们寻求将现役和预备役部队整合为一个单一混合组成结构的原因之一，“他告诉众议院拨款国防小组委员会。雷蒙德发表上述言论之前，在加州民主党人黛安·范斯坦（Diane Feinstein）和佛罗里达州共和党人马尔科·卢比奥（Marco Rubio）罕见的搭档领导下，5月11日，12名参议员在各自州设有空军国民警卫队太空部队，提议立法建立一个单独的太空警卫队。它是由参议员约翰·希肯洛珀，科罗拉多州，莉萨·穆尔科斯基，阿拉斯加州，迈克尔·班纳特，科罗拉多州，玛莎·布莱克本，田纳西州，乔·曼钦，弗吉尼亚州，罗布·波特曼，俄亥俄州，里克·斯科特，佛罗里达州，亚历克斯·帕迪拉，加利福尼亚州，迈克·布劳恩，印第安纳州共同发起的。和德克萨斯州的约翰·科宁。范斯坦在立法声明中说：“如果太空部队没有国民警卫队的组成部分，我们就有可能失去许多有才华的人，他们希望在离开现役后继续为他们的国家和州服务，这是完全不可接受的。”“建立一个太空部队国民警卫队也将节省资金，并确保在我们需要激活人员的情况下更顺畅的过程。在太空部队成立时，没有建立太空国民警卫队是一个错误，这项法案将弥补这一点。“自2019年12月太空部队成立以来，这个问题一直在酝酿，国民警卫队领导层公开表示需要一个新的分支机构。事实上，在2020年初，最高警卫队副官将军与五角大楼决裂，公开支持单独的太空警卫队，并开始了一场国会游说运动。因此，代表约45，000名现任和前任警卫的美国国民警卫队协会(NGAUS)周四表示支持范斯坦-卢比奥法案也就不足为奇了。“大约1000名太空专业人员在八个州和地区的16个空军国民警卫队中。NGAUS新闻稿称：“它们提供了军方60%的空间电子战能力，唯一的移动、可生存的导弹预警能力和100%的增援能力。”但在过去的两年里，这些高素质的人在空军中基本上是“孤儿”，NGAUS负责人J.罗伊·罗宾逊在新闻稿中说。“这使得获得所需资源和专业发展变得复杂，”他说。5月11日，雷蒙德的二把手DT汤普森将军在参议院军事委员会战略部队小组委员会面前说，该部门希望在2024年预算下降之前完成一项关于如何最好地将空军国民警卫队目前的成员整合到太空服务的研究。汤普森提醒立法者，拜登政府去年正式拒绝了这一概念，并重申了为希望加入太空部队的现任空军国民警卫队成员开辟道路的重要性。汤普森说：“我们不能没有他们今天提供的能力和任务，走向未来。”然而，他回应了亚利桑那州参议员马克·凯利的论点支持单独的太空警卫队，解释说正在进行的太空部队研究也在考虑如何取代目前任何专注于太空的警卫队，这些警卫队可能不希望重新定位加入新的太空组成部分。“我们不假设这些成员是否会接受或希望这一转移。汤普森说：“作为评估的一部分，我们当然要确定用太空部队成员取代这些成员需要什么--需要的人数、需要的训练时间、需要的训练资源，以及当我们将这些部队恢复到完全状态时，任务的相应退化。”", "中文源标题": "加州参议员黛安·范斯坦（Diane Feinstein）在宣布一项拟议的法案以“弥补这一缺陷”时表示，立法后，没有建立太空国民警卫队的听证会是“太空部队成立时的一个错误”。", "英文整编": "On May 3, US Space Operations Secretary Raymond said at the hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee that there are two ways to establish the Space Guard: one is to establish an independent Space National Guard, and the other is to merge the space personnel of the National Guard into the Space Army to form a regular active army. Reserve soldiers and active soldiers are merged into one regular active force component.On the 11th, 12 Senate members cooperated with the States where the space part of the National Guard is located to propose a legislation calling for the establishment of an independent Space National Guard. Congressman Feinstein said in the legislative announcement that if the Space Force does not set up the National Guard, the United States will lose a lot of talents who hope to continue to serve the country after retirement, and the creation of the Space Force National Guard will save money and ensure a smoother national defense mobilization process. When the Space Army was established, it was a mistake not to establish the Space National Guard, and the bill will correct this. On the same day, the American Civil Guard Association (NGAUS), which represents about 45,000 current and former guards, expressed support for the bill, saying that about 1,000 space professionals are distributed in 16 Air Force National Guards in 8 States and regions, and these people provide 60% of space electronic warfare capabilities, the only mobile and survivable missile early warning capabilities and all reinforcement capabilities, but it is difficult for them to obtain resources and develop professional capabilities within the Air Force in the past two years.

You have to have ‘compute’ [computing power] wherever you need it. And networks—you have to be able to get data from anywhere to anywhere. You have to have software that makes it easy for a warfighter to interpret that picture and to make a decision.”\nSuch “ubiquitous connectivity,” for one, may be “very close,” Knausenberger said, with the addition of more mobile and space-based connections—“where maybe we don’t have to carry around quite as much gear as we used to, to just get a connection.”\nAdding AI to achieve intelligent warfare will involve “basic automations all the way through neural networks, deep learning,” she said, with the expectation that in the future, AI will be a part of all of the Defense Department’s weapon platforms.\nBut while AI is already commonplace in everyday life, that’s just not yet the case in the DOD, “and part of that is because it’s a lot easier to do AI at scale when you are already in the cloud,” Knausenberger said: “You already have really clean training quality data that you’ve been collecting across a large populous legally for decades.”\nThe department hasn’t yet incorporated AI consistently into its existing “20-year-old platforms,” though “some of them we have, and so I’d say that we are on the right path. We still have some work to do both in the lab and on the battlefield.”\nThe real “game-changing effect” of intelligent warfare, she said, comes into play “when you have a convergence of a number of different things.” Zero-trust IT architecture and the joint all-domain command and control concept qualify as “big convergence things.”\nThe DAF’s and DOD’s zero-trust implementation plans are already converging, she said of strategyto make IT infrastructure more secure, “and we’re actually making decisions together across the entirety of zero trust.”\nIn the long run, the vision is one of automation and intuitive interfaces—“that when you show up and you need to put in place that war-fighting effect, that you’re not trying to figure out a complex system to do it,” Knausenberger said. “You have the data at your fingertips.

Gen. James Dawkins, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, told the Mitchell Institute today that the scale of the silo conversion effort is something the service’s nuclear complex hasn’t seen in “over 50 or 60 years.” Not only does it involve updating outmoded computers and software, but also building new underground facilities, he explained.\n“What the defense industry needs to know … is it’s, again, on a scale that we’ve not seen in decades,” he said.\nDawkins noted that when the Minuteman silos were originally built, they were dug into empty fields and equipped with new kit. But the new effort will involve both renovation and new construction.\n“We’re having to go to those sites that have already have equipment and decommission them, dig some of it away, destroy some of the facilities, and then put new facilities where those old facilities were. And so this is the challenge. If you’re going to do one per week for nine years, that’s what the average is, that’s quite a big level of work,” he said.\nMaj. Gen. Michael Lutton, commander Air Force Global Strike Command’s 20th Air Force responsible for maintaining and operating the ICBM force, said that on the up side, the service and its contractor team have some recent experience that could help reduce the timeline for conversion — via a test silo built in Promontory, Utah, where Northrop Grumman has facilities related to development of the Sentinel, formerly called the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. Northrop won the $13.3 billion contract to build GBSD in 2020. It expects to conduct its first test flight in 2023, with production of the missiles beginning in 2026, Greg Manuel, vice president of Northrop’s Strategic Deterrent Systems division told Breaking Defense back September 2021.\n“About a year and a half, almost two years ago, there was a Minuteman III launch facility that was built from the ground up, and the contract team has basically taken that Minuteman III launch facility that they built and used it to experiment with how they are going to convert the existing launch facilities out in the missile complex,” Lutton explained. “That should take some time off the clock.”\nHe further noted that the Air Force is looking at sustainment of the new missile silos in a new way that should also increase efficiency.\n“The concept is not going to be executed the same way we sustain Minuteman III; i.e., we have a main base, and then you spoke out from that main base out into the missile complex. I would anticipate an effort where you’ll have smaller logistics sustainment hubs forward out in the complex,” Lutton said.\n“So you’re actually cutting down the amount of time the contractors are transiting back and forth from a main base like an [Francis E. Warren AFB near Cheyenne, Wyoming] to western Nebraska or northern Colorado or eastern Montana,” he added. “Those little efficiencies I think are critical when you look at the macro scale. ”\n", "中文原文": "华盛顿--据空军一名高级核计划官员称，空军正准备对其450个装有民兵III洲际弹道导弹的发射井进行现代化改造，以适应现在被称为哨兵的替代品--这是一项“重大任务”，该部门希望能在21世纪20年代中后期开始。负责战略威慑和核一体化的副参谋长詹姆斯·道金斯中将今天告诉米切尔研究所，发射井转换工作的规模是该部门核综合体“50或60年”以来从未见过的他解释说，这不仅涉及更新过时的计算机和软件，还包括建造新的地下设施。“国防工业需要知道的是……这是我们几十年来从未见过的规模，”他说。道金斯指出，当民兵发射井最初建造时，它们被挖到空地上，并配备了新的装备。但新的努力将涉及翻新和新的建设。“我们不得不去那些已经有设备的地方，让它们退役，挖走一些设备，摧毁一些设施，然后把新设施放在旧设施的地方。所以这就是挑战。如果你要连续九年每周做一次，这就是平均水平，这是一个相当大的工作水平，“他说。空军全球打击司令部负责维护和运营洲际弹道导弹部队的第20航空队指挥官迈克尔·卢顿少将说，从另一方面来看，该部队及其承包商团队最近有一些经验，这可能有助于缩短转换的时间表--通过在犹他州海角建造的测试筒仓，诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司在那里拥有与哨兵（以前称为地面战略威慑）的发展有关的设施。诺斯罗普在2020年赢得了133亿美元的建设GBSD的合同。诺思罗普战略威慑系统部门副总裁格雷格·曼努埃尔（Greg Manuel）在2021年9月告诉《断防》，预计将于2023年进行首次试飞，导弹生产将于2026年开始。卢顿解释说：“大约一年半前，差不多两年前，有一个民兵三号发射设施是从头开始建造的，合同团队基本上已经利用了他们建造的民兵三号发射设施，并用它来试验他们将如何在导弹综合体中改造现有的发射设施。”“那应该需要一些时间。”他进一步指出，空军正在考虑以一种新的方式维持新的导弹发射井，这也应该提高效率。“这个概念不会像我们支持民兵三号一样得到执行；也就是说，我们有一个主基地，然后你从主基地向导弹综合体说话。卢顿说：“我预计会有一个努力，在这个综合体中，你会有更小的后勤维持中心。”“因此，你实际上减少了承包商从主基地（怀俄明州夏延附近的弗朗西斯·沃伦空军基地）到内布拉斯加州西部、科罗拉多州北部或蒙大拿州东部来回转机的时间，”他补充说。“我认为，从宏观层面来看，这些小小的效率至关重要。“", "中文源标题": "美国空军将在十年结束前开始民兵III发射井改造为哨兵洲际弹道导弹", "英文整编": "A senior U.S. Air Force nuclear program official said the Air Force is preparing to modernize its 450 silos containing Militia III intercontinental ballistic missiles to suit its replacement, now called \"Sentinel,\" a \"major task\" that the Air Force hopes to start in the mid-to late 2020s.The deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration told the Mitchell Institute that the scale of the silo retrofit effort had not been seen \"in more than 50 or even 60 years.\" He explained that this involves not only updating outdated computers and software, but also building new underground facilities."}, {"中文标题": "美海军东部舰队战备中心测试飞机腐蚀检测新技术", "情报来源": "英国海军技术网站", "时间": "2021年7月5日", "整编内容": "美国海军东部舰队战备中心(FRCE)正在探索快速准确检测飞机腐蚀并防止其扩散的新方法。近日，FRCE的F-35闪电II项目测试并演示了一种新的工具，能够帮助识别飞机涂层的腐蚀情况。该工具被称为Gray Gecko实时检测工具或GRIT系统，通过中波红外(IR)相机“视觉穿透”飞机涂层并记录下表面的图像。\n目前大多数飞机的检测方法都是使用传统工具进行目视检测。这些检测非常耗时，有时需要去除涂料等额外的工作，且要基于检测人员的技术、经验和对细节的关注，具有高度主观性。此次演示的无损检测工具有助于更快、更客观地进行腐蚀检查，从而减少腐蚀增长、降低成本，并提高飞机的可用性。据估计，使用 GRIT 系统进行无损检测可以将腐蚀导致的飞机停机时间减少近 25%，并在某些应用中减少50%以上的检测人力需求。\n此次演示旨在评估设备功能和局限性，探索该工具在基地和舰队环境中的应用潜力。目前，FRCE 工程师们已经在各种飞机面板和F-35 维护教练机机身上测试了该工具，未来将探索如何将其整合到现有的腐蚀和检测程序中，提高检测效率。", "关键词": "", "整编机构": "兵器210所", "源网址": "https://militaryleak.com/2021/07/04/frce-explores-new-technology-in-fight-against-aircraft-corrosion/", "源标题": "US Navy’s FRCE tests new aircraft corrosion detection technology", "原文": "The F-35 Lightning II programme at US Navy’s Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) has tested a tool that can help detect corrosion on aircraft.\nKnown as Grey Gecko Real-Time Inspection Tool (GRIT) system, the tool can help identify corrosion through coatings.\nFRCE F-35 Joint Program Office site lead Matt Crisp said: “Corrosion is a recurring theme across all forms of aviation, resulting in huge cost and fleet availability impacts.\n“Current detection methods for most aircraft involve visual inspection using traditional tools.\n“These inspections are time consuming, sometimes require additional efforts like removing paint, and can be highly subjective based on inspector techniques, experience and attention to detail.”\nAccording to Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), the tool uses a mid-wave infrared (IR) camera to ‘visually penetrate’ the aircraft coatings and record images of the surface below.\nResearch and technology solutions proider Grey Gecko estimates that the use of GRIT for non-destructive inspection can reduce corrosion-caused aircraft downtime by nearly 25% and lower the requirement of inspection manpower by over 50% in some applications.\nAs part of the GRIT demonstration, a team of engineers from aircraft lines across the depot and members of the Naval Air Systems Command Advanced Technology and Innovation (ATI) Team at FRCE discussed the tool with its designers at Grey Gecko.\nFRCE is the largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider in North Carolina.

The hollowness of the unit particles allows low density and yet high tensile stiffness from the overall fabric.\nOctagonal units make the whole (Image credit: NTU Singapore)\nThe individual “unit particles” are topologically interlocked, meaning that they are linked like chain mail, constraining the unit particles to form the shape of a continuous loose fabric. The paper does indeed state that the fabric is more like a 2 dimensional structure overall, despite the obviously 3 dimensional unit particles. The chain mail specimens were printed in single pieces, ready to function.\nTo control the stiffness, the researchers placed the chain mail into a transparent plastic back, and removed the air from the bag using vacuum. This effectively compressed the unit particles together, causing the unit particles to jam together, restricting the movement of each particle, and therefore increasing the stiffness of the overall fabric structure. In fact the mechanism by which these particles lock together is called “jamming transition”, because they jam together, see?\nThe pressure increases the packing density of the fabric, causing each particle to have more contact with its neighbours, resulting, for the octahedron-based fabric, in a structure that is 25 times more rigid.\nWhen formed into a flat, table-shaped structure and vacuum-locked in place, the fabric could hold a load of 1.5kgs, more than 50 times the fabrics’ own weight.\nThe nature of the octahedrons also means that the structure can lock into non-planar shapes as well, such as this bridge shape…\nBridge shape carrying a load (Image credit: Caltech)\nIn another experiment, the researchers dropped a small, 30 gram steel ball onto the chain mail. The impact deformed the fabric by up to 26 mm when it was relaxed, but by only 3 mm when it was stiffened, a six times reduction in penetration depth.\nTesting the impact resistance of the material when unjammed (soft).

And we’re usually pretty keen on talking about the dichotomy between the two,” Sneden said. “The perception, I think, that’s out there is that we’re maintaining, if not advancing, our military advantage in propulsion. And that’s always been because we’ve always had the world’s greatest advantage in propulsion. But the reality is that our lead is starting to—we’re essentially stagnating, and we’re starting to lose our lead.”\nPart of the problem, Sneden claimed, is a relative lack of propulsion projects being pushed by the Air Force. The Adaptive Engine Transition Program, aimed at developing next-generation propulsion technologies, launched in 2016, but other science and technology programs have yet to follow.\n“We’ve had no large combat engine science and technology program in our labs since 2018. AETP was the last big program that came out of that,” Sneden said.\nFrom an operational perspective, “we haven’t done a new fighter engine, transitioned it to the field, since essentially the F135 in the early 2000s timeframe,” Sneden said.\nFor more than a decade, Congress, the Pentagon, and industry members had considered the idea of an alternate engine for the F-35 fleet, with proponents saying it was necessary to increase competition and drive down costs.\nThat idea never came to fruition, however. And with no other major fighter engine programs transitioning to production since, “from an industrial base perspective, you start to get some atrophying of it, if you don’t continue to push the marketplace forward to drive those outcomes,” Sneden said.\nInstead, the Air Force has turned to legacy engines to power new programs such as the F-15EX and T-7A—the F-15EX will use the the F110-GE-129, while the T-7 will have the F404-103. And while industry officials have promised that these new engines will provide upgraded performance, “inserting brand new technology into our legacy propulsion systems … means that you’re not … really exercising that advanced propulsion side with the industrial base,” Sneden said.\nThat issue could become even more urgent in the near future, as the Air Force, the F-35 Joint Program Office, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense consider the future of F-35 propulsion. The fighter has endured engine issues that have kept jets grounded and sent sustainment costs soaring.\nThere’s a consensus that something must be done, but Pratt & Whitney, which makes the F135, is pushing for what it calls the F135 Enhanced Engine Package, an update of the existing system, while GE Aviation is advocating for its AETP engine, the XA-100.\nShould leaders decide to stick with the F135, Sneden warned that the future of AETP would be murky at best. Beyond that, only one other advanced propulsion program is in the works, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program, and Sneden said the Air Force, constrained by a lack of resources, will have to commit to a vendor for that program by late 2024.\n“If we end up with one vendor there and we don’t move forward with AETP, that vendor could actually get us into a place where we have essentially a reduced advanced propulsion industrial base,” Sneden said. “So we are concerned about it.”\nLack of competition isn’t the only concern. Sneden also pointed to declining funds for the propulsion directorate’s Component Improvement Program, which is focused on safety and reliability. In 2021, the initiative got $121 million in the Air Force’s budget.

NASA already has completed testing of engines for the first fourArtemismissions as part of the agency’s plan to return humans, including the first woman and first person of color, to the Moon in preparation for eventual missions to Mars.\nThis latest round of testing is part of an ongoing program to develop new RS-25 engines and components for future Artemis deep space missions. During each phase, engineers are introducing newly fabricated components on developmental engines. The components tested in this series include newly fabricated turbopumps, ducting, harnesses, and valves. Also included will be a previously tested pogo accumulator. Manufactured with selective laser melting, the pogo accumulator dampens propellant pressure oscillations during vehicle ascent.\n“Our team has worked hard over the past several years to update the designs of several key RS-25 components and fabricate them using advanced manufacturing techniques in order to streamline the production process and significantly reduce cost,” said Jeff Zotti, Aerojet Rocketdyne’s RS-25 program director for Aerojet Rocketdyne, lead contractor for SLS engines. “The Retrofit-3 test series will allow our engineers to validate the performance of these new components.”\nTest data will help Aerojet Rocketdyne ensure RS-25 engines meet NASA's mission guidelines for human missions to the Moon and Mars. To ensure quality performance, operators will compare data for the modern engine components manufactured using new techniques against prior data from components developed using older manufacturing methods.\n\"It is exciting to be starting this next test series that gets us closer to newly-manufactured RS-25 engines,\" said Chip Ellis, Stennis RS-25 test project manager. \"These new production RS-25s will power SLS to further exploration for years to come.”\nTheprevious roundof RS-25 testing concluded with removal of RS-25 developmental engine No. 0528 from the A-1 Test Stand on Oct. 25. During that series, operators collected data from a series of seven hot fire tests conducted Jan. 28 to Sept. 30 and confirmed that all primary test objectives were successfully achieved.\nNASA is building SLS as the world’s most powerful rocket. SLS and the Orion spacecraft, along with the commercial human landing system and the Gateway in orbit around the Moon, are NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration. The agency is working towards the launch of theArtemis Iuncrewed flight test in upcoming months, which will pave the way for future missions with astronauts.\nRS-25 tests at Stennis are conducted by a combined team of NASA, Aerojet Rocketdyne and Syncom Space Services operators. Syncom Space Services is the prime contractor for Stennis facilities and operations.\nCUTLINE: NASA conducts a full-duration (500 seconds) hot fire test of RS-25 developmental engine No. 0525 on the Fred Haise Test Stand at Stennis Space Center on Dec. 15. The hot fire marked the first in a new series of tests to collect performance data for production of RS-25 engines to help power NASA’s Space Launch System rocket on future deep space missions.\n", "中文原文": "美国宇航局12月15日进行了一次成功的全程测试，开始了对最先进的RS-25发动机的新一系列测试，以帮助为该机构的太空发射系统(SLS)提供动力，这是美国新的深空火箭，在未来的月球和火星任务中。12月15日，美国宇航局在斯坦尼斯航天中心的弗雷德·海瑟试验台上对RS-25研制发动机0525进行了全时段（500秒）热火测试。这场大火标志着一系列新测试的第一次，该测试旨在收集RS-25发动机的性能数据，以帮助美国宇航局的太空发射系统火箭在未来的深空任务中提供动力。学分：NASA/SSC新系列的第一次热火是在密西西比州圣路易斯湾附近的斯坦尼斯航天中心的theFred Haise试验台（前A-1试验台）上进行的，持续500秒。即将到来的测试时间表分为三个阶段：计划于明年春季进行的五项初步系列测试将使用第0525号开发发动机，收集各种新发动机部件的性能数据，这些部件采用最先进的制造技术，如热等静压键合和选择性激光熔化，以降低制造新发动机的成本和时间。第二阶段的12项测试将于明年夏天开始，在加州德索托的Aerojet Rocketdyne工厂使用所有新零件生产的认证发动机。它与阿尔忒弥斯四号之后正在为飞行制造的新发动机相同。认证系列之后将进行第三阶段的12项测试，并将与开发发动机一起进行，开发发动机将有许多与认证发动机相同的部件，也将用于认证飞行的新发动机。阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔马歇尔太空飞行中心的SLSliquidenginesManagere约翰尼·赫夫林（Johnny Heflin）表示：“这些新发动机将与用于早期阿尔特弥斯任务的航天飞机时代的升级发动机具有相同的高性能，但预计比航天飞机项目的发动机节省30%以上的制造成本。”“这些测试确保了新发动机为新一代SLSflights做好准备。”四个RS-25发动机，以及一对固体火箭助推器，将帮助SLS在发射时提供动力。同时发射，发动机将在升空时产生160万磅的推力，在上升时产生200万磅的推力。美国国家航空航天局已经完成了第一次四项任务的发动机测试，这是该机构将人类，包括第一位女性和第一位有色人种，送回月球的计划的一部分，为最终的火星任务做准备。最新一轮测试是正在进行的项目的一部分，该项目旨在为未来的阿尔特弥斯深空任务开发新的RS-25发动机和部件。在每个阶段，工程师们都在开发发动机上引入新制造的部件。本系列测试的部件包括新制造的涡轮泵、导管、线束和阀门。还包括一个以前测试过的pogo累加器。pogo蓄能器采用选择性激光熔化技术制造，可在车辆上升过程中抑制推进剂压力振荡。SLS发动机的主要承包商Aerojet Rocketdyne的RS-25项目总监杰夫·佐蒂（Jeff Zotti）表示：“在过去的几年里，我们的团队一直在努力更新几个关键RS-25部件的设计，并使用先进的制造技术进行制造，以简化生产过程，大幅降低成本。”“Retrifit-3测试系列将使我们的工程师能够验证这些新组件的性能。”测试数据将帮助航空喷气式火箭发动机确保RS-25发动机符合美国宇航局的人类月球和火星任务指南。为了确保质量性能，运营商将使用新技术制造的现代发动机部件的数据与使用旧制造方法开发的部件的先前数据进行比较。Stennis RS-25测试项目经理Chip Ellis说：“开始下一个测试系列让我们更接近新制造的RS-25发动机，这是令人兴奋的。”“这些新生产的RS-25将为SLS在未来几年的进一步勘探提供动力.”前一轮RS-25测试于10月25日结束，从A-1试验台上移除了RS-25开发发动机0528号。在该系列中，运营商从1月28日至9月30日进行的一系列七次热火测试中收集了数据，并确认所有主要测试目标都成功实现了。美国宇航局正在建造SLS作为世界上最强大的火箭。SLS和猎户座宇宙飞船，以及商业人类着陆系统和绕月轨道上的门户，是美国宇航局深空探索的支柱。该机构正在努力在未来几个月内发射theArtemis Iuncrewed飞行试验，这将为未来的宇航员任务铺平道路。在斯坦尼斯进行的RS-25测试是由美国宇航局、航空喷气火箭动力公司和同步空间服务运营商的联合团队进行的。同步", "中文源标题": "美国宇航局用新组件“点燃”阿尔特弥斯RS-25火箭发动机", "英文整编": "On December 15th, NASA successfully organized an RS-25 engine ignition test.

Credit: Northrop Grumman\nThe infrared imaging payload — called PIRPL (short for prototype infrared payload) — is a 110-pound multispectral camera that will collect data on the low Earth orbit environment\nWASHINGTON — A Northrop Grumman spacecraftscheduled to launch Aug. 10on a resupply mission to the International Space Station will deliver 8,200 pounds of crew supplies, hardware and science experiments.\nAmong the science payloads on board Cygnus NG-16 is an infrared imaging sensor that will collect data on the lowEarth orbit environment. The Pentagon’s Space Development Agency will use the data to develop thermal sensors that can detect hypersonic missiles and other advanced weapons while in flight.\nCygnus NG-16 will fly on a Northrop Grumman Antares rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS on Aug. 12.\nThe infrared imaging payload — called PIRPL (short for prototype infrared payload) — is a 110-pound multispectral camera also made by Northrop Grumman under a $13.8 million contract from the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Missile Defense Agency.\nThis is SDA’s first experiment in support of itsTracking Layer, a planned constellation of small sensor satellites in low Earth orbit. \n“Upon arrival at the Space Station, PIRPL will begin collecting infrared data and expanding detection capabilities that will aid in the development of algorithms for the next generation of tracking satellites,” Northrop Grumman said Aug. 9 in a news release.\nPIRPL will gather imagery through the entire NG-16 mission expected to last about three months. After Cygnus leaves the space station, PIRPL will be released fromthe spacecraft and briefly operate in free flying mode so it can collect more data from different angles before it burns up in the atmosphere, an SDA official said during a call with reporters. \nThe imagery “will help us understand what Earth infrared backgrounds look like from this type of orbit,” the SDA official said.\nCurrent U.S. military missile-warning satellites have powerful infrared sensors that can detect ballistic missile launches from geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles above Earth. SDA’s Tracking Layer satellites will be in lower orbits at about 600 miles so the agency needs sample data to develop algorithms that can identify targets amid the clutter.\n“One of the objectives is to look at what we can do from LEO orbits which are fairly new for these types of missions,” the official said. “We need to understand what the atmosphere, clouds, earth surface, land and ocean all look like at various times of day and night.”\nSDA and the Missile Defense Agency want to “show that we can do those missions at a lower Earth orbit, that we are able to get much closer to the threats,” the agency official said. Another reason for the PIRPL experiment is to test how sensors perform when they’re moving at very fast speeds in low orbits, compared to current staring sensors on geostationary satellites.\n“We call that a complex background,” the SDA official said of low Earth orbit. “We need to check whether LEO data can be processed successfully to do the same missions that we do well in high orbit.”\n", "中文原文": "Bysandra Erwin-2021年8月9日对于NG-16任务，天鹅座宇宙飞船将搭载诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的安塔瑞斯火箭发射，为国际空间站运送大约8200磅的补给品、设备和实验。信用：诺斯罗普·格鲁曼红外成像有效载荷--称为PIRPL（原型红外有效载荷的简称）--是一个110磅重的多光谱相机，将收集低地球轨道环境的数据华盛顿--一艘诺思罗普·格鲁曼公司的宇宙飞船计划于8月10日发射，执行向国际空间站的再补给任务，将运送8200磅的船员用品、硬件和科学实验。天鹅座NG-16上的科学有效载荷包括一个红外成像传感器，它将收集洛厄斯轨道环境的数据。五角大楼太空发展署将利用这些数据开发热传感器，可以在飞行中探测高超音速导弹和其他先进武器。天鹅座NG-16将乘坐诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司的安塔瑞斯火箭从弗吉尼亚州美国宇航局瓦洛普斯飞行设施的大西洋中部地区太空港起飞。它计划于8月12日与国际空间站会合。红外成像有效载荷--被称为PIRPL（原型红外有效载荷的简称）--是一台110磅重的多光谱相机，也是由诺斯罗普·格鲁曼公司根据太空发展局(SDA)和导弹防御局1380万美元的合同制造的。这是SDA支持itsTracking Layer的首次实验，itsTracking Layer是一个计划中的低地球轨道小型传感器卫星星座。诺思罗普·格鲁曼公司8月9日在一份新闻稿中说：“抵达空间站后，PIRPL将开始收集红外数据，并扩大探测能力，这将有助于开发下一代跟踪卫星的算法。”PIRPL将通过整个NG-16任务收集图像，预计将持续大约三个月。一名SDA官员在与记者的电话中说，天鹅座离开空间站后，PIRPL将从航天器中释放出来，并在自由飞行模式下短暂运行，以便在它在大气层中燃烧之前从不同角度收集更多数据。SDA官员说，这些图像“将帮助我们理解从这种类型的轨道上看地球红外背景是什么样子的”。目前，美国军用导弹预警卫星拥有强大的红外传感器，可以探测从地球上方22，000英里的地球同步轨道上发射的弹道导弹。SDA的跟踪层卫星将在大约600英里的较低轨道上，因此该机构需要样本数据来开发能够在杂波中识别目标的算法。这位官员说：“目标之一是看看我们可以从低轨轨道上做些什么，这对这类任务来说是相当新的。”“我们需要了解大气、云、地球表面、陆地和海洋在白天和黑夜的不同时间都是什么样子。”该机构官员表示，SDA和导弹防御局希望“表明我们可以在较低的地球轨道上执行这些任务，我们能够更接近威胁”。PIRPL实验的另一个原因是测试传感器在低轨道上以非常快的速度移动时的性能，与目前地球静止卫星上的凝视传感器相比。“我们称之为复杂的背景，”SDA官员在谈到低地球轨道时说。“我们需要检查低轨数据是否能成功处理，以完成我们在高轨道上做得很好的任务。”", "中文源标题": "国防部飞往国际空间站为导弹跟踪传感器收集数据的实验", "英文整编": "The Cygnus NG-16 spacecraft, which Northrop Grumman plans to launch to the International Space Station on August 10, 2021, will be equipped with an Infrared Load Prototype (PIRPL) to collect infrared data of low Earth orbit environment.

Ben Ring, director for Cyber Command’s Joint Cyber Warfighting Architecture Capability Management Office, said during a discussion as part of C4ISRNET’s CyberCon.\n“That CONOPs defines how we envision employing and integrating the various capabilities in an operational context so we can articulate how we envision putting these capabilities together and employing them for the capability development community in order to better bring it together and provide some basic attributes and some concepts that we want to make sure is baked in — things like resiliency and security at the onset,” he said Nov. 10.\nTo better define roles and responsibilities as well as address integration issues with the various capabilities under development by each service, Ring said the command set up a capability management office with an integration office to better oversee development.\n“As we evolve, continue to bring in feedback, we are constantly trying to improve ourselves so we can be the best force going forward,” he said.\nBut Ring acknowledged integration challenges remain.\n“We are evolving and we are beginning some initial direct integration across the different programs,” he said. “You’re integrating across multiple services, multiple programs, and each of the services — they have different personnel systems, different training systems, and trying to bring that together is working, we’re evolving. But it’s as you can imagine, it’s taking some time to bring that together. We’re continuously gathering feedback from the force and continuing to evolve, as we are one team to try to achieve unified mission.”\n联系人：李祯静 15727330595\n", "中文原文": "比马尔·波默洛11月11日凌晨2时22分网络司令部创建了一个集成办公室和一个作战概念，以帮助更好地指导如何在联合网络作战架构下集成新的能力。（上士雅各布·奥斯本/美国海军陆战队）华盛顿--美国网络司令部根据国会和政府监督机构的关切和建议，创建了一个行动概念，并建立了一个能力管理办公室，以解决其网络能力重点架构的问题。政府问责局2020年11月的一份报告提出了网络司令部联合网络作战架构的目标和指导问题，该架构指导了司令部的采购和装备优先事项。在架构定义的六个大类别中，每一个服务都代表联合部队构建组件，这就产生了集成问题。国会还对司令部的愿景缺乏连接系统的治理战略表示担忧。网络司令部联合网络作战体系结构能力管理办公室主任本·林上校（Ben Ring）在一次讨论中说，为了解决总署围绕互操作性目标的担忧之一，网络司令部创建并发布了一份作战概念（CONOPs）文件，这是C4ISRNET网络通信的一部分。他在11月10日表示：“COOPS定义了我们如何设想在运营环境中使用和集成各种能力，这样我们就可以清楚地说明我们如何设想将这些能力放在一起，并为能力开发社区使用它们，以便更好地将其放在一起，并提供一些基本属性和一些我们希望确保根深蒂固的概念--比如一开始的弹性和安全性。”为了更好地定义角色和责任，并解决每个军种正在开发的各种能力的集成问题，林说，司令部成立了一个能力管理办公室，下设一个集成办公室，以更好地监督开发。“随着我们的发展，继续带来反馈，我们不断努力提高自己，这样我们就可以成为前进的最佳力量，”他说。但Ring承认整合挑战仍然存在。“我们正在发展，我们开始在不同的项目中进行初步的直接整合，”他说。“你正在整合多个服务、多个项目和每一个服务--它们有不同的人事系统、不同的培训系统，试图将这些整合在一起是有效的，我们正在发展。但正如你所能想象的，这需要一些时间来整合。我们不断从警队收集反馈，并继续发展，因为我们是一个团队，试图实现统一的使命。“：15727330595", "中文源标题": "美国网络司令部发布整合新能力的概念", "英文整编": "With the consideration and suggestion of the US Congress and government regulatory agencies, the US Cyber Command has created relevant operational concepts, and established a capability management office and an integration office to solve the key architecture problems of its network capabilities and help better guide how to integrate new capabilities under the joint network operations architecture.

Saadi coats a compound of sulfur and selenium onto steel to test its ability to protect the surface from biotic and abiotic contaminants. Photo by Jeff Fitlow\nAn insulator of sulfur and selenium made with flexible devices in mind may have found its true destiny: As an anticorrosive coating for steel.\nThe compound developed by the Rice University lab of materials scientist Pulickel Ajayan proved itself more dielectric (insulating) than most flexible materials and more flexible than most dielectrics, making it a good candidate for components in electronics like bendable cellphones.\nAt the same time, the material had its creators thinking: What else can it do?\n“Even before we reported on the material for the first time, we were looking for more applications,” said materials scientist Muhammad Rahman, principal investigator on the study and an assistant research professor of materials science and nanoengineering in the George R. Brown School of Engineering.\n“So we thought, let’s put it in salt water and see what happens,” he said.\n“Atop all that, we found the viscoelastic coating is self-healing,” said Rice graduate student and co-lead author M.A.S.R. Saadi.\nAn illustration shows the simple process of combining powdered sulfur and selenium into a compound able to protect mild steel from the elements. Courtesy of the Ajayan Research Group\nThe results of experiments at Rice and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, found in Advanced Materials, could be a boon for infrastructure -- buildings, bridges and anything above or below the water made of steel -- that requires protection from the elements.\nThe researchers pointed out that sulfur-selenium combines the best properties of inorganic coatings like zinc- and chromium-based compounds that bar moisture and chlorine ions but not sulfate-reducing biofilms, and polymer-based coatings that protect steel under abiotic conditions but are susceptible to microbe-induced corrosion.\nIn the first test of the material, the lab coated small slabs of common “mild steel” with the sulfur-selenium alloy and, with a plain piece of steel for control, sank both into seawater for a month. The coated steel showed no discoloration or other change, but the bare steel rusted significantly, they reported. The coating proved highly resistant to oxidation while submerged.\nTo test against sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are known to accelerate corrosion up to 90 times faster than abiotic attackers, coated and uncoated samples were exposed for 30 days to plankton and biofilms. The researchers calculated an “inhibition efficiency” for the coating of 99.99%.\nThe Rice compound also performed well compared to commercial coatings with a similar thickness of about 100 microns, easily adhering to steel while warding off attackers.\nFinally, they tested the alloy’s self-healing properties by cutting a film in half and placing the pieces next to each other on a hotplate. The separated parts reconnected into a single film in about 2 minutes when heated to about 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) and could be folded just like the original film. Pinhole defects were healed by heating them at 130 C (266 F) for 15 minutes.\nSubsequent tests with the healed alloys proved their ability to protect steel just as well as pristine coatings.\nRice University materials scientist Muhammad Rahman, left, and graduate student M.A.S.R.

Photo by Jeff Fitlow\n“If you give the alloy a poke, it recovers,” Rahman said. “If it needs to recover quickly, we assist it using heat. But over time, most thick samples will recover on their own.” He said the lab still needs to test whether thin layers of about 100 microns will heal without assistance.\nThe lab is tweaking the material for varieties of steel and looking into coating techniques. “The first target is structures, but we’re aware the electronics industry faces some of the same problems with corrosion,” Ajayan said. “There are opportunities.”\nAdditional co-lead authors of the paper are Rice alumna Sandhya Susarla, now a postdoctoral scholar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and technology engineer Govind Chilkoor and research scientist Jawahar Kalimuthu of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.\nCo-authors are Rice alumni Yufei Cui and Thierry Tsafack, postdoctoral researchers Anand Puthirath and Soumyabrata Roy, graduate students Samuel Castro Pardo and Morgan Barnes, and Rafael Verduzco, a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and of materials science and nanoengineering; Pawan Sigdel and Bharat Jasthi of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology; Taib Arif, Parambath Sudeep, Aly Hassan and Tobin Filleter of the University of Toronto; Leiqing Hu and Haiqing Lin of the State University of New York at Buffalo; Md Golam Kibria of the University of Calgary; and Santiago Solares of George Washington University.\nCo-principal investigators are Nikhil Koratkar of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Venkataramana Gadhamshetty of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

In the future such unmanned aircraft, called Remote Carriers, can serve as force multipliers for various missions, while keeping the pilots out of harm’s way. Manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) will allow the Remote Carriers to operate in concert with manned aircraft, opening new fields of tactics to surprise, deceive, deter, saturate and strike opponents.\nDuring the A400M flight test, an Airbus-built Do-DT25 drone, acting as a surrogate Remote Carrier, was released over a test range in Northern Germany. Shortly after the launch, the drone’s parachute opened, delivering it safely to the ground. Throughout the test, the drone was connected and transmitting data to the A400M “mother aircraft”. This data transfer illustrates how Remote Carriers can be connected to a combat cloud network, providing vital information by serving the role of “eyes and ears” over the battlefield, whilst also enabling them to be tasked by the manned aircraft’s operators during their missions.\nBuilding up the expertise in manned-unmanned teaming\nThe A400M air-launch demonstration involved a joint flight test crew from the German Air Force and Airbus. The new Modular Airborne Combat Cloud Services (MACCS), also an Airbus product, enabled full connectivity between the airlifter and the drone.\nAirbus will continue validation of the A400M as an airborne launch platform for Remote Carriers, envisioning the ability to deploy large numbers of these drones.

As opposed to regular powder bed-based systems, the demonstrator is said to process wire feedstock affixed to its frame, stopping it floating away, and allowing the unit to operate in microgravity conditions.\nLaunched by the ESA, with the goal of creating the world’s first system capable of 3D printing with alloys in orbit, the Metal3D project will see it work with various partners to identify the impact microgravity has on the properties of parts produced.\nTo achieve this, the ESA has commissioned the construction of two identical demonstrators, with one being built and operated in Toulouse alongsideAirbus, and the other launched to the ISS’ Columbus module. Naturally, in order to allow for an accurate assessment of orbital conditions on metal printed components, the system is being developed to function both on Earth and in microgravity conditions.\nOther partners tasked with enabling the program to meet its objectives, include a team fromCranfield University, which is overseeing the unit’s energy and material delivery systems, andHighftech, an R&D specialist that’s in charge of looking after the build of the machine’s enclosure in addition to its fluid management.\nFor its part in the mission, AddUp has not only developed some of the unit’s internals, but the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) used to control it, as well as the interface that will allow it to communicate. According to AddUp R&D Engineer Alexandre Piaget, the firm also played a key role in the Metal3D’s project’s pre-planning stages, which “built the foundations of what the machine is today.”\n, but its involvement in the project goes back to the pre-project phase where the feasibility of the project had to be demonstrated,” explains Piaget. “In the final version of the machine, AddUp will be in charge of the mobile axes, the structural parts and the software of the machine.”\nIn terms of the machine itself, it’s said to be capable of overcoming the issues that prevent regular 3D printers being used in space, i.e. the risks posed by fine powder floating from the build area. The system accomplishes this by using a wire-laser combination (W-DED) process, which sees alloys fixed in place, before being laser fused together on a table that’s moved along 3 linear axes and 1 rotary axis.\nThe 3D printer is also set to be operated under a nitrogen atmosphere, as a means of limiting the oxidation of materials and reducing the risk of combustion, plus, given that nitrogen is in short supply on the ISS, the system is fitted with filtering and cooling functionality, to limit consumption and recycle as much gas as possible.\nThough the machine isn’t expected to be fired into orbit until February 2023, AddUp has revealed that it’s already developing a machine inspired by Metal3D along with Airbus, which will “allow developments on this technology to continue.”\nThose interested in finding out more about the progress of Metal3D can check outAddUp’s orbital 3D printing updatesvia its YouTube channel, and it has committed to providing more of these insights in the weeks and months ahead.\n", "中文原文": "作为欧洲航天局(ESA)“Metal3D”项目的一部分，AddUp已经建立了一台机器的内部结构和机制，专门设计用于在太空中3D打印金属零件。与常规的粉末床系统相反，该演示器据说处理固定在其框架上的金属丝原料，阻止其漂浮，并允许该设备在微重力条件下运行。Metal3D项目由欧空局发起，目标是创建世界上第一个能够在轨道上用合金进行3D打印的系统，它将与各种合作伙伴合作，确定微重力对生产零件性能的影响。为了实现这一目标，欧空局委托建造了两个相同的示范器，其中一个在图卢兹与空客一起建造和运行，另一个发射到国际空间站的哥伦布舱。当然，为了能够准确评估金属印刷部件的轨道条件，正在开发该系统，以便在地球和微重力条件下都能运行。负责使该项目实现其目标的其他合作伙伴包括来自克兰菲尔德大学的一个团队，该团队负责监督该机组的能源和材料输送系统，以及HighfTech公司，该公司是一名研发专家，除了流体管理之外，还负责管理机器外壳的建造。在这次任务中，AddUp不仅开发了该单元的一些内部部件，还开发了用于控制该单元的可编程逻辑控制器(PLC)，以及允许该单元进行通信的接口。根据AddUp研发工程师亚历山大·皮亚杰（Alexandre Piaget）的说法，该公司在Metal3D项目的前期规划阶段也发挥了关键作用，这“为今天的机器奠定了基础”。但它对项目的参与可以追溯到项目前阶段，在那里必须论证项目的可行性，“皮亚杰解释道。在机器的最终版本中，AddUp将负责机器的移动轴、结构部件和软件。就机器本身而言，据说它能够克服阻止普通3D打印机在太空中使用的问题，即从建筑区漂浮的细粉带来的风险。该系统通过使用金属丝-激光组合（W-DED）工艺来实现这一点，该工艺将合金固定在适当的位置，然后在沿着3个线性轴和1个旋转轴移动的工作台上激光熔合在一起。3D打印机还将在氮气氛下运行，作为限制材料氧化和降低燃烧风险的一种手段，此外，鉴于国际空间站上氮供应短缺，该系统配备了过滤和冷却功能，以限制消耗并尽可能多地回收气体。尽管该机器预计要到2023年2月才能发射到轨道上，但AddUp透露，它已经在与空客一起开发一种受Metal3D启发的机器，这将“允许这项技术的发展继续下去”。那些有兴趣了解更多关于Metal3D进展的人可以通过其YouTube频道查看outAddUp的轨道3D打印更新，它承诺在未来几周和几个月内提供更多这些见解。", "中文源标题": "法国工业3D打印机制造商Duphas透露，它一直在帮助开发的一个新系统将被发射到国际空间站(ISS)的轨道上进行测试。", "英文整编": "AddUp, a French manufacturer of industrial 3D printing equipment, said that a new system it participated in developing will be sent to the International Space Station for testing.

AddUp not only developed some of the internal structure of the device, but also developed a programmable logic controller (PLC) and communication interface for control.In order to solve the risk caused by powder floating in the printing area in space, the space metal 3D printing equipment developed by the project adopts W-DED process, in which metal wires are fixed on a workbench with three linear axes and one rotating axis, and then fused together by laser. The equipment operates in nitrogen atmosphere to avoid material oxidation and reduce combustion risk. At the same time, considering the shortage of nitrogen supply in the space station, the equipment is equipped with filtration and cooling system to recover excess nitrogen.

Made from layers of a 2D semiconductor and a transparent conductor held together by weak van der Waals interactions, the new device converts 93.8% of incident photons into electric current – far higher than the 50% typical for so-called “high performance” photoelectric devices – and can store charge for up to a week, making it suitable for applications in energy generation, photodetectors or light-based memory.\nVan der Waals (vdW) heterojunctions like the one used here are a common feature in devices such as photovoltaic cells and photodetectors. Often made from p-n junctions, they work by absorbing photons that then create electron-hole pairs. The next step is to separate the electrons from the holes, which is usually done by applying a voltage. The problem is that these charge carriers rapidly recombine, shortening their lifetime and therefore limiting the device’s external quantum efficiency (EQE).\nTemporarily trapping the carriers\nOne way to overcome this effect is by temporarily trapping the carriers (at crystal defects, for instance) before recombination can occur. A team of researchers led by Yucheng Jiang of the Suzhou University of Science and Technology in China and Cheng-Wei Qiu of the the National University of Singapore decided to use this strategy in a vdW p-n heterojunction made from tungsten selenide (WSe2) and strontium titanium oxide, or STO as it is commonly known.\nThe team found that when they excited their device with blue laser light and then stored it in the dark at a temperature of 30 K, the photogenerated charge carriers persisted for as long as seven days. They also found that they could extract a current as large as 2.9 mA when they connected the device to a circuit. The researchers attribute this unexpected effect to a special treatment that produced a nearly two-dimensional “electron gas” on the surface of the STO, in which electrons can move freely and independently.\n“Chargeable photoconductivity”\nThe researchers dubbed this new effect “chargeable photoconductivity”, and they say it is completely different to previously observed photoelectric phenomena. The device they made not only creates photocarriers under optical illumination but also stores them in the so-called “space-charge” region of the WSe2 film, which juxtaposes the interface with the STO crystal. Here, they explain, light-induced holes can accumulate and be retained until a sufficiently large applied voltage draws them into a circuit. During this process, the electron-hole pairs recombine and the device returns to the insulating state. It can then be charged anew by shining light on it.\nAlthough the device’s EQE is much higher than that of other high-performance photoelectric devices, Jiang and colleagues note that it only achieves this efficiency at temperatures of around 30 K, which are required to keep the stored charge stable. This low operating temperature will limit the device’s applications, although the researchers believe the operating temperature might be increased by employing materials other than WSe2 and STO.\nThe researchers report their work in Physical Review Letters.\n", "中文原文": "中国和新加坡的研究人员开发了一种光电系统，可以将光转化为电荷，然后像电池一样储存电荷--这是单个设备的第一次。这种新器件由一层二维半导体和一个透明导体通过弱范德华相互作用结合在一起，将93.8%的入射光子转化为电流--远远高于所谓“高性能”光电器件的50%--并可以存储长达一周的电荷，使其适合于能源产生、光电探测器或基于光的存储器的应用。范德华(vdW)异质结在光伏电池和光电探测器等器件中是一个常见的特征。它们通常由p-n结构成，通过吸收光子来产生电子空穴对。下一步是把电子从空穴中分离出来，这通常是通过施加电压来完成的。问题是，这些电荷载流子快速重组，缩短了它们的寿命，从而限制了器件的外量子效率(EQE)。临时诱捕携带者克服这种影响的一种方法是在复合发生之前暂时俘获载流子（例如在晶体缺陷处）。由中国苏州科技大学的Yuzheng Jiang和新加坡国立大学的Cheng-Wei Qu领导的一个研究小组决定将这种策略用于由硒化钨(WSe2)和钛氧化物锶（俗称STO）制成的vdW p-n异质结。该团队发现，当他们用蓝色激光激发他们的设备，然后在30K的温度下将其储存在黑暗中时，光生电荷载流子持续了长达7天。他们还发现，当他们将该设备连接到电路时，可以提取高达2.9mA的电流。研究人员将这种意想不到的效果归因于一种特殊处理，该处理在STO表面产生了一种近乎二维的“电子气”，电子可以在其中自由独立地运动。“可充电光电导”研究人员称这种新效应为“可充电光电导”，他们说这与以前观察到的光电现象完全不同。他们制造的器件不仅在光学照明下产生光载流子，而且将它们存储在WSe2薄膜的所谓“空间电荷”区域，该区域与STO晶体的界面并列。在这里，他们解释说，光致空穴可以积累并保留下来，直到足够大的外加电压将它们吸引到电路中。在此过程中，电子-空穴对重新组合，器件恢复到绝缘状态。然后，它可以通过在它身上发光来重新充电。尽管该器件的EQE远高于其他高性能光电器件，但蒋和他的同事指出，它只有在保持存储电荷稳定所需的30K左右的温度下才能达到这种效率。这种低的工作温度将限制该设备的应用，尽管研究人员认为使用WSe2和STO以外的材料可能会提高工作温度。研究人员在《物理评论快报》上报告了他们的工作。", "中文源标题": "混合器件既充当太阳能电池又充当蓄电池", "英文整编": "Recently, Singaporean researchers have developed the first photoelectric system equipment that can convert light into electric charge.

The technology is also reaching a limit to the size the diodes can be shrunk, limiting their sharpness and resolution.\nFor next-generation display technology, researchers are exploring inorganic micro-LEDs, which could perform better, require less energy, and last longer than OLEDs.\nBut micro-LED fabrication requires extreme accuracy, as microscopic pixels of red, green and blue need to first be grown separately on wafers, then precisely placed on a plate, in exact alignment with each other in order to properly reflect and produce various colors and shades. Achieving such microscopic precision is a difficult task, and entire devices need to be scrapped if pixels are found to be out of place.\n“This pick-and-place fabrication is very likely to misalign pixels in a very small scale,” Kim says. “If you have a misalignment, you have to throw that material away, otherwise it could ruin a display.”\nColor stack\nThe MIT team has devised a potentially less wasteful way to fabricate micro-LEDs that doesn’t require precise, pixel-by-pixel alignment. The technique is a vertical LED approach, in contrast to the conventional, horizontal pixel arrangement.\nKim’s group specializes in developing techniques to fabricate pure, ultrathin, high-performance membranes, with a view toward engineering smaller, thinner, more flexible and functional electronics. The team previously developed a method for growing and peeling away perfect, two-dimensional, single-crystalline material from wafers of silicon and other surfaces — termed 2D material-based layer transfer (2DLT).\nIn the current study, the researchers employed this same 2DLT approach to grow membranes of red, green and blue LEDs of near-submicron thickness on two-dimensional material-coated substrates via remote or van der Waals epitaxy. Mechanical release then allowed each LED membrane to be peeled away from their base wafers, before they were stacked together to form layers of red, green and blue membranes. Top-down fabrication then patterned them into vertical pixels, each just 4?m wide.\n“In conventional displays, each R, G and B pixel is arranged laterally, which limits how small you can create each pixel,” Shin notes. “Because we are stacking all three pixels vertically, in theory we could reduce the pixel area by a third.”\nAs a demonstration, the team fabricated a vertical LED pixel and showed that, by altering the voltage applied to each of the pixel’s red, green and blue membranes, they could produce various colors in a single pixel. “If you have a higher current to red, and weaker to blue, the pixel would appear pink, and so on,” Shin says. “We’re able to create all the mixed colors, and our display can cover close to the commercial color space that’s available.”\nThe team plans to improve the operation of the vertical pixels. So far, they have shown that they can stimulate an individual structure to produce the full spectrum of colors. They will work toward making an array of many vertical micro-LED pixels.\n“You need a system to control 25 million LEDs separately,” Shin says. “Here, we’ve only partially demonstrated that. The active matrix operation is something we’ll need to further develop.”\n“For now, we have shown to the community that we can grow, peel and stack ultrathin LEDs,” Kim says. “This is the ultimate solution for small displays like smart watches and virtual-reality devices, where you would want highly densified pixels to make lively, vivid images.”\nThe research was supported, in part, by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the US Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the US Department of Energy, LG Electronics, Rohm Semiconductor, the French National Research Agency, and the National Research Foundation in Korea.\n", "中文原文": "就像晶体管一样，LED正在达到一个极限，它们可以有多小，同时也能有效地工作。这在近距离显示器中尤其明显，如增强现实(AR)和虚拟现实(VR)设备，有限的像素密度导致了“屏蔽门效应”，用户可以在像素之间的空间中感知条纹。现在，麻省理工学院(MIT)领导的一个团队开发了一种新的方法来制造更清晰、无缺陷的显示器（“垂直全彩微发光二极管Via 2D Material-Based Layer Transfer”，Nature volume 614,P81-87(2023))。该团队设计了一种方法来堆叠二极管，以创建垂直的、多色的像素，而不是以水平拼接的方式并排替换红色、绿色和蓝色发光二极管。每个堆叠的像素可以产生全部商业范围的颜色和测量约4μm宽。微型LED的密度可以达到每英寸5000像素。麻省理工学院机械工程副教授Jeehwan Kim说：“这是期刊上报道的最小的微LED像素，也是最高的像素密度。”“我们表明，垂直像素是以更小的占地面积实现更高分辨率显示器的方法，”他补充道。金的研究小组的博士后Jiho Shin补充说：“对于虚拟现实来说，现在它们看起来有多真实是有限的。”“有了我们的垂直微型LED，你可以拥有完全沉浸式的体验，无法区分虚拟和现实。”金和申的合著者包括金实验室的成员、麻省理工学院的研究人员，以及来自佐治亚理工学院欧洲分校、世宗大学以及美国、法国和韩国多所大学的合作者。放置像素大多数现有的数字显示器是通过有机发光二极管（OLED）照明的，但随着时间的推移，这些发光二极管会退化，导致屏幕上的永久老化效应。这项技术也达到了二极管可以缩小的尺寸的极限，限制了它们的清晰度和分辨率。对于下一代显示技术，研究人员正在探索无机微型LED，它比OLED性能更好，耗能更少，寿命更长。但微型LED的制造要求极高的精确度，因为红色、绿色和蓝色的微观像素需要首先分别生长在晶圆上，然后精确地放置在平板上，彼此精确对齐，以便适当地反射和产生各种颜色和阴影。实现如此微小的精度是一项艰巨的任务，如果发现像素不合适，整个设备就需要报废。“这种选择和放置的制造很可能在很小的范围内错位像素，”金说。“如果你有一个不对齐，你必须扔掉那个材料，否则它可能会破坏显示器。”色彩堆叠麻省理工学院的团队设计了一种潜在的更少浪费的方法来制造微发光二极管，不需要精确的逐像素对齐。这种技术是一种垂直的LED方法，与传统的水平像素排列形成鲜明对比。Kim的团队致力于开发制造纯净、超薄、高性能薄膜的技术，以期开发更小、更薄、更灵活和功能更强的电子产品。该团队之前开发了一种从硅晶片和其他表面生长和剥离完美的二维单晶材料的方法--称为2D材料基层转移(2DLT)。在目前的研究中，研究人员使用同样的2DLT方法，通过远程外延或范德华外延，在二维材料涂层衬底上生长近亚微米厚度的红、绿、蓝发光二极管膜。然后，机械释放允许每个LED膜从其基础晶圆上剥离，然后将它们堆叠在一起形成红色、绿色和蓝色膜层。然后通过自上而下的制作将它们图案化为垂直像素，每个像素只有4米宽。“在传统显示器中，每个R、G和B像素都是横向排列的，这限制了你可以创建的每个像素的大小，”Shin指出。“因为我们垂直堆叠所有三个像素，理论上我们可以将像素面积减少三分之一。”作为一个演示，该团队制造了一个垂直的LED像素，并表明通过改变施加在像素红、绿和蓝膜上的电压，他们可以在单个像素中产生各种颜色。“如果你对红色有更高的电流，而对蓝色有更弱的电流，像素会呈现粉红色，等等，”申说。“我们能够创造所有的混合颜色，我们的显示器可以覆盖接近可用的商业色彩空间。”该小组计划改进垂直像素的操作。到目前为止，他们已经表明，他们可以刺激一个单独的结构，以产生全光谱的颜色。他们将致力于制作许多垂直微LED像素的阵列。“你需要一个系统来分别控制2500万个发光二极管，”申说。“在这里，我们只是部分证明了这一点。的", "中文源标题": "麻省理工学院领导的团队演示全彩垂直堆叠RGB微型led", "英文整编": "Recently, the research team led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology successfully developed a full-color vertical stacked Micro LED with an array density of 5100 PPI and a size of only 4 microns, which is the Micro LED with the highest array density and the smallest size known at present.

The THAAD interceptor carries no warhead but relies on the kinetic energy of the impact to destroy the incoming missile.

The multibillion-euro contract for the Eurodrone’s development, production and initial in-service support provisionally agreed to by the partner nations has yet to be signed, awaiting budgetary approvals from the government in Spain.\nLawmakers in France, Germany and Italy have already given the nod, but Madrid’s slower pace of approval looks set to nudge contract signing and program launch into 2022 at the earliest, with entry into service creeping toward 2030.\n“We are in the waiting phase basically every day with Spain,” Lohwasser said. “We fully understand that there are national processes to be followed and so on, but with approval, it will take maybe a couple of months more until we will be ready to finally go for the full contract signatures.”\nThe partner nations are collectively ordering 20 systems, each comprising three air vehicles. Germany will take seven systems, Italy five, while France and Spain will purchase four each.\nThe Eurodrone can be armed if the customer nation desires, and Germany’s new coalition government has stated that it will introduce legislation to allow the arming of UAS operated by the country’s armed forces.\nAs program lead, Airbus will undertake final assembly at the company’s facility in Manching, Germany. Airbus Germany will also lead on flight management and airspace integration, landing gear and the ground control system, while teams in Spain will build the fuselage and empennage, develop the ground safety control systems and integrate the engines. Dassault’s share includes work on flight and landing-system safety as well as communications and work on maintenance systems. Leonardo will build the UAS’ wings and develop the electrical and environmental control systems as well as the mission and armament systems.\nNo decision has been taken yet on propulsion, but two suppliers have been downselected: Safran with the Ardiden TP, and General Electric’s Catalyst, developed in the Czech Republic.\n“The plan is that right after contract signature, we will announce the engine provider, but not before,” Lohwasser said.\nUnder current timelines, within five months of launch the industrial partners want to set the safety and certification requirements, while a preliminary design review is penciled in for 13 months later. First flight is due to take place 62 months after project launch.\nThe Eurodrone will be the firstAirbusdefense program to make use of the company’s digital design, manufacturing and services approach end to end.\nIt will be the “guinea pig, setting the scene for many of our developments to come,” Lohwasser said.\n", "中文原文": "看来，当谈到欧洲开发中高度、长航时(MALE)无人驾驶航空系统时，尺寸很重要。凭借11公吨的最大起飞重量和30米（98英尺）的翼展，四国欧洲无人机看起来将成为迄今为止最大的军用涡轮螺旋桨动力无人机，是美国制造的通用原子收割者的两倍。该平台的规模此前曾引起愤怒，法国议员称该飞机过于肥胖和复杂，因为德国要求它在该国繁忙的领空不隔离飞行。但最近，德国空客公司与法国达索航空公司、意大利莱昂纳多公司和西班牙空客公司一起领导欧洲无人机的开发，对其中一些批评做出了回应，称该平台将是未来一代男性无人机的开拓者。“这不是大和重的问题；这是为了确保未来，“空客欧洲无人机首席工程师丹妮拉·洛瓦瑟在11月30日的公司贸易媒体简报会上说。Lohwasser说，Eurodrone将在无人机市场上开创一个新的趋势，因为它增加了航程，并具有更高的有效载荷能力，约为2300公斤（5070磅），明显高于其他男性平台。空客认为，欧洲无人机将很快找到传统战场情报、监视和侦察之外的其他角色，并可能被推进海上监视任务，这需要一套新的传感器，包括强大的搜索雷达。根据洛瓦瑟的说法，欧洲无人机的设计有增加机载系统的规定，如电力，以及增加重量，以容纳更多的武器和传感器。平台软件的开发使关键系统得以分离，从而能够更快地集成新的元素。两种发动机的选择也加强了民用认证的理由，该计划采用了欧盟航空安全局的CS-23通用、特技飞行和通勤飞机认证标准。洛瓦瑟认为，双引擎配置还降低了生命周期成本，因为维护需求减少，它们带来的额外性能应该能使欧洲无人机更具反应能力，因为它将比单引擎平台更快。“我们看到越来越多的这种车辆有两个引擎，”洛瓦瑟说。“我想说，这将成为新的市场常态。”即便如此，该计划仍处于悬而未决的状态。伙伴国家暂时同意的数十亿欧元的欧洲无人机开发、生产和初始服役支持合同尚未签署，等待西班牙政府的预算批准。法国、德国和意大利的立法者已经点头，但马德里较慢的批准速度似乎将合同签署和项目启动最早推迟到2022年，投入服务将推迟到2030年。“我们基本上每天都在等待西班牙，”洛瓦瑟说。“我们完全理解有国家程序要遵循，等等，但如果得到批准，可能还需要几个月的时间，直到我们准备好最终签署完整的合同。”伙伴国共同订购了20个系统，每个系统由三个飞行器组成。德国将购买七套系统，意大利五套，而法国和西班牙将各购买四套。如果客户国愿意，欧洲无人机可以武装，德国新联合政府表示，将出台立法，允许武装该国武装部队运营的无人机。作为项目负责人，空客将在该公司位于德国曼钦的工厂进行最终组装。空客德国公司还将在飞行管理和空域整合、起落架和地面控制系统方面领先，而西班牙的团队将建造机身和尾翼，开发地面安全控制系统并集成发动机。达索的份额包括飞行和着陆系统安全的工作，以及通信和维护系统的工作。莱昂纳多将建造无人机的机翼，开发电气和环境控制系统，以及任务和武器系统。目前还没有关于推进的决定，但两家供应商已经被淘汰：拥有Ardiden TP的赛峰和在捷克共和国开发的通用电气公司的催化剂。“计划是在合同签署后，我们将宣布发动机供应商，但不是在此之前，”洛瓦瑟说。根据目前的时间表，在发布后五个月内，工业合作伙伴希望设定安全和认证要求，而初步设计审查将在13个月后进行。首次飞行将在项目启动62个月后进行。Eurodrone将是第一个利用该公司数字化设计、制造和服务方法的BusDefense项目", "中文源标题": "业界看好引领潮流的欧洲无人机", "英文整编": "Eurodrone, a hollow long endurance (MALE) drone developed in Europe, has a maximum takeoff weight of 11 tons and a wingspan of 30 meters (98 feet).

The ship launched the SM-3 Block IIA toward the target over open ocean.\nMDA officials characterized FEM-01 as an experiment.\nNickolas Guertin, director of operational test and evaluation, told Congress and the defense secretary in his office’s 2022 annual report that FEM-01 was a “developmental test.”\n“The MDA conducted a developmental test of Aegis BMD, firing a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA guided missile against an MRBM target,” Guertin wrote. “Operational assets included overhead sensors, [Ballistic Missile Defense System （BMDS） Overhead Persistent Infrared （OPIR） Architecture （BOA）], [the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications system] and the Enterprise Sensor Processing Network at Buckley Space Force Base, Colorado.”\nGuertin’s report notes that his office observed the test only and that MDA was not required in advance to provide a test plan to his office for FEM-01.\nThe SM-3 Block IIA interceptor is a cooperative development project launched in 2006 with Japan. Developed by Raytheon and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the interceptor has a 21-inch-diameter body -- an increase from 13.5 inches used in earlier SM-3 variants -- to fly faster and farther in order to defend against short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.\nThe guided missile features two improvements on earlier variants: a larger motor and a larger kinetic warhead. The warhead has new improvements, including a seeker that improves search, discrimination and tracking functions.\nIn October 2019, Pentagon leaders approved the SM-3 Block IIA program, for transition to production -- signaling confidence in the interceptor after early flight-test challenges.\nIn November 2020, at the direction of Congress, MDA and the Navy executed a flight test to test the capability limits of the SM-3 Block IIA against a much longer-range target: a rudimentary intercontinental ballistic missile. The SM-3 Block IIA chased down the ICBM target and intercepted in that event.\nThe April 2022 experiment, FEM-01, included a medium range ballistic missile target. Since MDA and the Navy previously demonstrated the ability of the SM-3 Block IIA against this class of targets, it is likely this was not a typical MRBM target.\nOne former DOD official -- who still holds security clearances -- was not aware of last year’s FEM-01 when asked about it by a reporter but said: “If it is what I think it is, it is way too classified to speak about.”\nA second former DOD official, also not privy to FEM-01 before being asked about it by a reporter, speculated what MDA might have been up to.\n“I think it was a medium-range target that they enhanced or something,” the former senior DOD official said. “If I had to bet money, in future we’ll find out this was a hypersonic precursor test of some sort where they had something a hypersonic [missile] does -- some kind of glide phase or something like an inflight adjustment.”\n", "中文原文": "导弹防御局在太平洋上空秘密发射了美国最先进的宙斯盾导弹拦截器，直到现在还对标准导弹-3 Block IIA的高度机密潜在新能力进行了实验--一名五角大楼高级官员也称之为开发测试--保密。2022年4月9日，MDA和海军执行了宙斯盾武器系统-01(FEM-01)飞行实验，这一事件直到国防内部询问这项测试时才公开承认，五角大楼最高武器测试人员上周提交给国会的一份新报告中提到了这项测试。1月25日，MDA发言人马克·赖特（Mark Wright）对《国防内幕》(Inside Defense）表示：“美国导弹防御局成功收集了数据，此前美国海军水手乘坐一艘配备宙斯盾弹道导弹防御系统的驱逐舰向一个中程弹道导弹目标发射了一枚标准的导弹-3 Block IIA导弹。”赖特说：“由于标志着这次测试的安全考虑水平，当时没有发布新闻稿，现在也没有其他信息可以发布。”目标是从考艾岛的太平洋导弹靶场发射的；MDA通常命名参与测试和实验的特定船只，拒绝识别FEM-01中的阿利·伯克级驱逐舰。该船在开阔的海洋上空向目标发射了SM-3 Block IIA。MDA官员将FEM-01定性为实验。作战测试和评估主任尼科拉斯·格尔廷（Nickolas Guertin）在其办公室的2022年年度报告中告诉国会和国防部长，FEM-01是一项“发展测试”。Guertin写道：“MDA进行了宙斯盾BMD的开发测试，向MRBM目标发射了一枚标准的导弹-3 Block IIA导弹。”“作战资产包括头顶传感器、[弹道导弹防御系统(BMDS)头顶持久红外(OPIR)体系结构(BOA)]、[指挥和控制、战斗管理和通信系统]以及科罗拉多州巴克利太空部队基地的企业传感器处理网络。”Guertin的报告指出，他的办公室只观察了测试，MDA没有被要求提前向他的办公室提供FEM-01的测试计划。SM-3 Block IIA拦截弹是2006年与日本合作开发的项目。这种拦截器由雷神公司和三菱重工公司开发，其机身直径为21英寸，比早期SM-3变体使用的13.5英寸有所增加，可以飞得更快、更远，以防御短程至中程弹道导弹。这种导弹的特点是对早期变体的两个改进：一个更大的发动机和一个更大的动弹头。弹头有了新的改进，包括改进搜索、辨别和跟踪功能的导引头。2019年10月，五角大楼领导人批准了SM-3 Block IIA计划，用于向生产过渡--这表明了在早期飞行测试挑战后对拦截器的信心。2020年11月，在国会的指示下，MDA和海军进行了一次飞行测试，以测试SM-3 Block IIA对一个远距离目标的能力极限：一枚基本的洲际弹道导弹。SM-3 Block IIA追击洲际弹道导弹目标并在该事件中拦截。2022年4月的实验FEM-01包括一个中程弹道导弹目标。由于MDA和海军之前展示了SM-3 Block IIA对抗此类目标的能力，很可能这不是典型的MRBM目标。一名仍持有安全许可的前国防部官员在被记者问及去年的FEM-01时并不知道，但他说：“如果它是我认为的那样，它太机密了，不能谈论。”第二名前国防部官员在被记者问及FEM-01之前也不知情，他猜测MDA可能在做什么。“我认为这是一个中程目标，他们提高了什么，”这位前国防部高级官员说。“如果我必须赌钱，将来我们会发现这是一次高超音速前驱测试，在这种测试中，他们有高超音速导弹所做的事情--某种滑翔阶段或类似于空中调整的东西。”", "中文源标题": "MDA承认秘密SM-3 Block IIA分类能力实验", "英文整编": "Recently, the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) publicly admitted that it had secretly carried out SM-3 Block IIA interceptor development test.

The three-chip solution provides configurable gallium nitride (GaN) bias point autocalibration, enabling engineers to maximize system performance for different GaN power amplifiers (PAs) without changing the board design.\nThe new chipset optimizes one of the largest and most expensive parts of a phased-array system: the pulsed-energy storage capacitors. Through a new architecture, the solution reduces capacitance by up to 90%, shrinking system volume by up to 30% while reducing weight and operating costs.\n“This complete radar power solution integrates advanced technologies from across Qorvo, combining an innovative new power conversion architecture, our best-in-class GaN RF power amplifiers and efficient, reliable silicon carbide FETs,” says Philip Chesley, president of Qorvo’s High Performance Analog business.\nThe new three-stage solution consists of the following:\nACT43950 is a high-voltage constant-current capacitor charge controller that works with Qorvo’s silicon carbide power switches to provide fully programmable output voltage and current, allowing customers to maximize system performance. This regulator’s architecture, in conjunction with the following stages, minimizes power storage capacitor requirements.\nACT43850, an RF point-of-load (RFPoL) step-down DC-DC power converter, takes the output from the ACT43950 and steps it down to a well-regulated voltage optimized for Qorvo GaN power amplifiers. Its advanced configuration options allow RF system designers to minimize noise and EMI, maximizing the performance of the radar array.\nACT43750 is a highly integrated drain switch and negative gate voltage regulator power management integrated circuit (PMIC) that enables ultra-fast RF GaN PA drain switching. By automating gate voltage bias sequencing, autocalibration and dynamic bias recalibration, Qorvo simplifies system manufacturing while mitigating the effects of device aging and temperature on RF performance.\nQorvo offers an evaluation board (CB1-750-850-950) that allows customers to test the performance of this three-stage solution with a wide set of RF GaN PAs.

Due to COVID-19, the event marks the first FIA in four years. As such, the show has acted as a meeting place for those in aviation, space, and defense to reconnect and establish cross-industry partnerships. \nThat said, this year’s FIA hasn’t just been about multimillion-dollar business deals; it has also seen MELD, GKN Aerospace, Burloak Technologies, Skyrora, and more open up on cutting-edge 3D printing advances. In one such case, MELD CEO Nanci Hardwick told 3D Printing Industry’s Paul Hanaphy, who attended the event early in the week, about how her firm uses 3D printing to meet US defense needs. \n“You may know that the US Army is currently building the world’s largest metal 3D printer with MELD technology,” said Hardwick. “The motivation of the Army is to be able to create entire tank hulls that have a monolithic structure. So, no weldments, no weaknesses, due to melting metal, because this is the place of most weakness and therefore most threatening for soldiers’ lives inside the vehicle.” \n“IF WE CAN CREATE A MONOLITHIC STRUCTURE WITH FORGED PROPERTIES LIKE MELD IS CAPABLE OF PRINTING, THEN WE INCREASE WARFIGHTER SAFETY.”\nMELD 3D printing called into action \nWorking out of its base in Christiansburg, Virginia, MELD is the developer of a unique solid-state 3D printing method, in which materials don’t require melting during deposition. Unlike traditional metal 3D printing, this Additive Friction Stir Deposition process takes place below melting temperature and sees a rod of material pushed through a hollow rotating tool, in a way that ‘smears’ it onto a substrate below. \nWhile the technology’s rotating tool has the effect of heating the material, and making it soft enough for such severe deformation to happen, feedstocks are never heated to the point of melting. Given that this process, in which the feed is then lifted and pushed back to enable layered deposition, doesn’t need to take place in a controlled atmosphere chamber, it also unlocks new large-format possibilities. \n“This [our technology] enables so many opportunities,” explains Hardwick. “Because we’re staying below the melt temperature, we can print literally any metal, and there’s no other technology that I’m aware of that can say that at this scale. As we’re printing in an open atmosphere, there’s also no limit on size.” \nAs well as facilitating the creation of monolithic prints by fitting its technology to a 10 x 6.5 x 4-meter build volume Ingersoll Machine Tools system for the US Army, Hardwick adds that the firm’s technology has extensive repair application potential. \n“Let’s say you’re in a forward operating situation, and you have a very large piece of turbomachinery equipment,” she says. “Our machines can be taken to that facility, operated in open air, and carry out repairs. In many cases, parts must be replaced because there is no existing repair technology. Now you can repair with the original material and satisfy concerns about repair [technologies] in that way.” \nGKN issues DED innovation update\nWhile MELD is primarily focused on the development of its 3D printing offering, GKN Aerospace operates mainly in the aerospace field. However, not wishing to miss out on the technology’s potential in the sector, the firm continues to contribute to many related R&D programs, which revolve around laser metal deposition by wire (LMD-w) or powder-based directed-energy deposition (DED) 3D printing. \nSpeaking to 3D Printing Industry at FIA 2022, Henrik Runnemalm VP of the firm’s Swedish Global Technology Centre, explained that since the early-2000s, it has been successful in adopting both technologies, with parts produced via the processes “out there flying today,” but it “continues to push the limit.”\nOne way GKN Aerospace is attempting to do so is by working as part of initiatives in the US, UK, and Sweden to hone different technical elements of DED, ranging from control systems to data acquisition. In doing so, Runnemalm says the company aims to build a portfolio that allows it to achieve “the holy grail of bringing certified products to market.”\n“Our DED journey has been made,” added Runnemalm. “On the other side, we have explored different techniques, both laser-based and electron beam melting. It has been a little bit harder to come up with all the necessary steps to be able to certify these types of technologies, but we’re pushing them forward. Our ambition is to get to zero-defect [parts], we’re pushing 3D printing in that direction.”\nSkyrora and Burloak reach for the stars \nOver in the FIA’s Space Zone, meanwhile, UK-based rocket manufacturer Skyrora was exhibiting just days after announcing that its new engine test facility in Scotland has opened its doors. At the show, the company’s Business Communications Officer Nickie Finnegan explained why it chose to develop its Skyprint 2 3D printer, and deploy it in the build of the Skyrora XL rocket being assembled there. \n“We did so for a few reasons,” said Finnegan. “We have sustainability as one of our core objectives. So it uses a lot less resources when produced through additive manufacturing, and we can also localize our supply chain by having that 3D printer on-site. Which is also good for economic purposes. As far as the actual design of the vehicles go, the materials we use are a lot more efficient in terms of weight.” \n“WE’RE LOOKING TO REUSE COMPONENTS IN THE FUTURE AND WE’RE TRYING TO FIND MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE ROBUST TO WATER, SO THERE’S QUITE A FEW REASONS FOR US USING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING.”\nElsewhere at the event, Canadian production service provider Burloak Technologies was also happy to talk 3D printing in the context of advanced space-faring components. During 2020, the firm revealed that it had been contracted by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) to develop durable 3D printed satellite parts, via its fleet of laser powder bed fusion, electron beam and DED machines. \nIn an interview with 3D Printing Industry, Burloak Technologies’ VP and GM Jason Ball, provided a deep-dive into how adopting 3D printing in such builds helps clients realize lightweighting and part consolidation opportunities.\n“You can take parts that are traditionally machined and make them significantly lighter, which really helps in aerospace,” elaborated Ball. “You can join parts together in the assembly process, you print them all in one part. We can also use exotic materials such as Invar, a thermally-stable material, to produce optical components for satellites. So there are a lot of niche things we can do to help customers out.”\n“I think additive [manufacturing] is at the beginning of a journey if it’s going to be a disruptive technology,” he added. “People are going to learn how to design parts to take advantage of it. We’re going to see the portfolio grow as we go and consolidate more and more parts, and design them very differently to how we do today.”\nBoom, Pratt & Whitney in aviation advances \nLastly, in civil aviation, it was announced that Pratt & Whitney had installed a Velo3D Sapphire system in the run-up to FIA 2022. Although the firm’s team had nothing to add on the subject at the event, it has a storied history of using the technology, having previously 3D printed turbofan engine parts alongside GKN Aerospace, and worked with Norsk Titanium to 3D print an integrally bladed rotor. \nAhead of the event, the company’s CEO Benny Buller said that he was eager to see how Pratt & Whitney “innovates its most mission-critical designs,” and “how the economies of scale of an in-house system help increase addressable use-cases.”\nOn the second day of FIA 2022, Boom Supersonic also unveiled a revamped design of its upcoming Overture supersonic commercial airliner. Following 26 million hours of simulated software designs, five wind tunnel tests, and 51 iterations, the revised aircraft now features a contoured fuselage and gull wings, designed to improve its drag and fuel efficiency, as well as its subsonic and transonic handling.\nAt the company’s press conference, its CEO Blake Scholl suggested that “state of the art technologies” were used to develop “every component and every system” in the new Overture, without specifying what these were. However, given that the craft’s XB-1 demonstrator includes 21 3D printed parts, it’s plausible that these design changes involved the technology on some level as well.\n", "中文原文": "在本周的范堡罗国际航展(FIA)上，来自世界各地的制造商和承包商借此机会展示了基于3D打印的创新在航空航天领域的活跃和良好。尽管英国气温高达104华氏度（40摄氏度），但全球航空航天公司还是来到范堡罗镇，展示他们最新的技术成就。由于新冠肺炎，这项活动标志着四年来的第一次国际汽联。因此，该展览为航空、航天和国防领域的人提供了一个重新联系和建立跨行业伙伴关系的聚会场所。也就是说，今年的国际汽联不仅仅是数百万美元的商业交易；MELD、GKN Aerospose、Burloak Technologies、Skyrora等公司也在尖端3D打印技术方面取得了进展。在一个这样的例子中，MELD首席执行官南奇·哈德威克（Nanci Hardwick）告诉3D打印行业的保罗·哈纳菲（Paul Hanaphy)，她的公司是如何使用3D打印来满足美国国防需求的。“你可能知道，美国陆军目前正在用MELD技术建造世界上最大的金属3D打印机，”哈德威克说。“军队的动机是能够创造出具有整体结构的整个坦克壳体。因此，没有焊接，没有弱点，因为金属熔化，因为这是最弱点的地方，因此对车辆内士兵的生命最有威胁。““如果我们能创造出一种具有锻造性能的整体结构，就像MELD能够打印一样，那么我们就能提高战斗机的安全性。”MELD 3D打印付诸行动MELD在弗吉尼亚州克里斯蒂安斯堡的基地工作，是一种独特的固态3D打印方法的开发者，在这种方法中，材料在沉积过程中不需要熔化。与传统的金属3D打印不同，这种添加剂搅拌摩擦沉积过程发生在低于熔化温度的情况下，看到一根材料棒通过空心旋转工具，以一种将其“涂抹”到下面的基底上的方式。虽然该技术的旋转工具具有加热材料的效果，并使其足够柔软以发生如此严重的变形，但原料从未被加热到熔化的地步。考虑到这一过程，即进料然后被提升和推回以实现分层沉积，不需要在受控气氛室中发生，它也开启了新的大幅面可能性。“这项（我们的技术）提供了如此多的机会，”哈德威克解释道。“因为我们保持在熔化温度以下，我们可以打印任何金属，据我所知，没有其他技术可以在这种规模下打印。因为我们是在开放的气氛中印刷的，所以尺寸也没有限制。“哈德威克补充说，该公司的技术不仅通过将其技术安装到美国陆军10×6.5×4米的英格索尔机床系统上，促进了整体印刷品的创建，还具有广泛的修复应用潜力。“假设你处于向前运行的情况下，你有一个非常大的涡轮机械设备，”她说。“我们的机器可以被带到那个设施，在露天操作，并进行维修。在许多情况下，零件必须更换，因为没有现有的修理技术。现在你可以用原始材料进行修复，并以这种方式满足对修复（技术）的担忧。“GKN发布DED创新更新虽然MELD主要专注于3D打印产品的开发，但GKN Aerospace主要从事航空航天领域的业务。然而，该公司不希望错过该技术在该行业的潜力，继续为许多相关的研发项目做出贡献，这些项目围绕激光金属镀膜（LMD-w）或基于粉末的定向能量镀膜(DED)3D打印。该公司瑞典全球技术中心副总裁亨里克·伦内马尔姆（Henrik Runnemalm）在国际汽联2022年对3D打印行业发表讲话时解释说，自21世纪初以来，它成功地采用了这两种技术，通过工艺生产的零件“今天就在那里飞行”，但它“继续突破极限”。GKN Aerospace尝试这样做的一种方式是，作为美国、英国和瑞典倡议的一部分，磨练DED的不同技术元素，从控制系统到数据采集。Runnemalm说，通过这样做，该公司的目标是建立一个投资组合，使其能够实现“将认证产品推向市场的圣杯”。“我们的DED之旅已经完成，”Runnemalm补充道。“另一方面，我们探索了不同的技术，包括激光熔化和电子束熔化。想出所有必要的步骤来认证这些类型的技术有点困难，但我们正在推动它们向前发展。我们的目标是实现零缺陷（零件），我们正在向这个方向推进3D打印。“Skyrora和Burloak向星星伸手与此同时，在国际汽联的太空区，英国的火箭m", "中文源标题": "航空航天3D打印创新在2022年范堡罗航展上腾飞", "英文整编": "At this week's Farnborough International Air Show (FIA), manufacturers and distributors from all over the world demonstrated the development and innovation of 3D printing technology in aerospace and national defense fields. Due to the epidemic, this is the first FIA event in four years, so this exhibition has become an important platform for rebuilding ties and building cross-industry partnerships in aviation, aerospace and national defense fields. Therefore, this year's FIA not only means millions of dollars in transaction volume, but also witnessed the development trend of MELD, GKN Aerospace, Burloak Technologies, Skyrora and other enterprises in the field of 3D printing technology.The U.S. Army is currently using MELD's technology to build the world's largest metal 3D printer, aiming at manufacturing the tank body of the whole structure. At present, the traditional method of whole structure metal casting without welding points is the weakest link, which poses a great threat to the lives of soldiers in cars. If MELD 3D printing technology can be used to create a whole structure with forging properties, the combat safety can be improved.MELD is the developer of a unique solid-state 3D printing method, in which materials do not need to melt during deposition. Different from traditional metal 3D printing, this additive friction stir deposition process can work below the melting point, similar to a way of \"smearing\" it to the substrate. This technology presents a lot of development opportunities, because almost any metal can be printed by keeping it below the melting temperature, and no other technology can do this on this scale. Because it is printed in an open environment, there is no limit to the size. In addition, the company also has great potential in restoration technology.

Sustainability of development is one of the main reasons. When additive materials are used for manufacturing and production, less resources are needed, and the supply chain can be localized by installing 3D printers on site; Secondly, from the perspective of actual structural design, the material use efficiency is higher; In addition, the reuse rate of components and the need for higher water resistance of materials are also one of the reasons for adopting additive manufacturing.Burloak Technologies, a Canadian production service provider, revealed that in 2020, it signed a contract with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) to develop new 3D printing satellite components through laser powder bed fusion, electron beam and DED, so as to achieve the goal of lightweight and component integration. Lightweight components are very helpful to the aerospace industry. All parts can be printed as a whole in the assembly process, and special materials (such as thermal stable material Invar alloy) can be used to produce optical components for satellites.Finally, in the field of civil aviation, Pratt & Whitney announced the installation of Velo3D Sapphire system.

The Air Force’s low ranking in readiness hinges on an annual average of 130 flight hours for pilots and insufficient investment in fifth-generation stealth aircraft most capable of facing peer adversaries. The Space Force was rated as “weak” across the board.\n“On the Air Force, we’re a bit puzzled by its investment strategy,” index editor Dakota Wood said. The analyst said the Air Force was “spending more on research and development to have an Air Force that it would like to have in the 2030s, while it’s not buying enough of current production aircraft to replace its aging current fleet.”\nThe demands of two decades of war wore out the fleet, which has an average age of 31 years. Research and development dollars continue to outpace procurement, and the Air Force plans to cut 137 fighters and 32 tankers from its fleet by the end of fiscal 2022, leaving it at 69 percent of the Air Force that last fought a peer rival, the report finds.\n“USAF currently is at 86 percent of the capacity required” to fight two major regional contingency operations, according to the report. “However, the disposition of those assets limits the ability of the service to deploy them rapidly to a crisis region. While the active fighter and bomber assets that are available would likely prove adequate to fight and win a single regional conflict, when coupled with the low mission capability rates of those aircraft …, the global sourcing needed to field the required combat fighter force assets would leave the rest of the world uncovered.”\nUsing the 2018 National Defense Strategy as a guidepost, the report cites mission capable rates of between 52 and 74 percent for legacy aircraft (fourth-generation and below) as insufficient to face a peer rival. It also notes a shortfall of 1,925 pilots, a number that improved slightly over the past year due to the lack of commercial hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report also highlighted historic lows in sortie rates at less than 1.5 per week and flying time at 131 hours per year.\nThe report says the low rates are far below “healthy fighter force thresholds” of three sorties a week and 200 hours a year per pilot.\nCOVID had a severe effect on flight hours and sorties, the report assesses, and Heritage states that it will take several years of training for fighter pilots to recover what they lost in 2020. “Unfortunately, the Air Force is not moving on that path and will cut 87,479 flying hours from its budget in FY 2022—a reduction of 7 percent,” the report states.\nSenior research fellow John “JV” Venable, 25-year Air Force veteran, told Air Force Magazine the purchase of fourth-generation aircraft over fifth-generation platforms puts the U.S. at a clear disadvantage against a peer rival.\n“The Chinese and the Russians do not fear fourth-generation platforms,” he said. “But they do fear the F-35. That says a lot about what we should be buying right now.”\nThe Air Force asked to buy 12 F-15EXs in its 2022 budget request and included another dozen F-15EXs in its 2022 unfunded priorities list. However, in a notable break from tradition, the service did not request any new F-35 strike fighters in its 2022 unfunded priorities list.\n“We could be applying that funding into the fifth-gen fighter force and actually moving the ball forward with regard to capability of our assets,” Venable said.\nNeither the Air Force nor Space Force could immediately respond to a request for comment on the report’s findings.\nSpace Force Gets Failing Grade\nVenable said the report rates the 2-year-old Space Force as “weak” based on aging and unprotected satellites, lack of space domain awareness, and insufficient offensive and defensive capabilities.\n“The Space Force is not capable of meeting current—much less future—on-demand, operational, and tactical-level warfighter requirements,” states the report.\nVenable said the Marshall Islands-based Lockheed Martin radar tracking system called Space Fence, which went online in 2020, only provides updates on the movement of some 26,000 objects every two hours.\n“In between those two hours, what those platforms do, those satellites or missiles, … we wouldn’t have known that because of the limitation on our spaceborne and our land-based surveillance platforms,” he said, citing recent reports that China flew a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide vehicle through space in August.\nVenable said the Space Force needs radars and satellites with optics to see spaceborne platforms and changes in the domain on a more regular basis.\nHouse Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama agreed that space-based platforms are lacking.\n“Space-based platforms, unmanned assets, and more distributed logistics capabilities are essential to deterring China,” he said, also citing reports of the Chinese hypersonic missile test.\n“We’re not in a good place,” Rogers told Air Force Magazine in a pull-aside interview when asked about U.S. hypersonics progress an event launch marking the launch of the report. “What I’m telling you is that we’ve got some things going on that are going to put us in a great place.”\nRogers, who keynoted the launch event, cited classified information in the hypersonics area that was “really exciting.” He also said he is not worried about recent Air Force failed hypersonics tests.\n“It’s one of the things I keep trying to get members to get accustomed to,” he said. “I want people to push the envelope and fail because every time you test and fail, you learn something. That’s how Kim Jong Un finally developed a missile that could reach the United States.”\nThe report is complimentary of the President’s proposed $17.4 billion 2022 budget for Space Force, a 13 percent increase over FY 21, but it highlights ongoing growing pains.\nHeritage praises Space Force for assimilating 60 disparate offices related to space from across DOD in its first two years, but warned that a significant portion of the 21,200 space professionals that remain in the Army and Navy must be incorporated into the Space Force to “remedy the dysfunctional oversight or command and control issues that the Space Force initiative was intended to resolve.”\nThe report says it is not likely such transfers will be complete until fiscal year 2024 or later. The transferring of space-related units and missions from the Army and Navy has been delayed by the failure of Congress to pass a 2022 budget.\nVenable said the Space Force is also behind adversaries such as China in terms of offensive capabilities in space. He said the U.S. has ground-based blinding assets that can temporarily impede a satellite’s operations, whereas China has anti-satellite missiles on Earth and laser platforms on orbit right now.\n“We have no true, at least unclassified, systems that can take an offensive punch to the Chinese,” he said.\nRogers also addressed the Space Force’s apparent lack of space weapons compared to the known capabilities of adversaries China and Russia.\n“We intentionally are moving or developing Space Force in a layered effort over a five- or six-year period,” he said. “I expect us to, as it matures, to continue to put more and more money in what they’re developing both offensively and defensively. So, I’m pretty pleased with where we are there. I would like to be pacing that well in other areas.”\n", "中文原文": "传统基金会（Heritage Foundation）在10月20日发布的2022年美国军事实力指数中，将空军和太空军都列为“薄弱”，列举了从第四代平台的低准备状态和投资失调到空间领域意识和进攻性空间武器不足以匹配同行能力等问题。华盛顿特区的保守派智库遗产（Heritage）将空军能力和能力评为“边缘”，排名居中，同时将战备程度和整体空军分为“弱”，从非常弱到非常强，分为五个等级。空军的低准备等级取决于飞行员每年平均130小时的飞行时间，以及对最有能力面对同行对手的第五代隐形飞机的投资不足。太空军被全面评为“弱”。“在空军方面，我们对其投资策略有点困惑，”指数编辑达科塔·伍德说。这位分析师表示，空军“在研发上投入了更多资金，以拥有一支它希望在21世纪30年代拥有的空军，而它没有购买足够的现有生产飞机来取代其老化的现有机队。”二十年战争的需要使这支平均年龄为31岁的舰队精疲力竭。报告发现，研发资金继续超过采购，空军计划到2022财年结束时从其机队中削减137架战斗机和32架加油机，使其成为上次与同行竞争对手作战的空军的69%。根据该报告，“美国空军目前处于打击两个主要地区应急行动所需能力的86%”。“然而，这些资产的处置限制了服务部门将它们迅速部署到危机地区的能力。虽然现有的现役战斗机和轰炸机资产可能足以战斗并赢得一场地区冲突，但当加上这些飞机的低任务能力率时……，部署所需战斗战斗机资产所需的全球采购将使世界其他地方一无所获。“该报告以2018年国防战略为指导，指出传统飞机（第四代及以下）52%至74%的任务能力不足以面对同行竞争对手。报告还指出，飞行员短缺1925人，由于新冠肺炎疫情期间缺乏商业招聘，这一数字在过去一年略有改善。该报告还强调了每周不到1.5架次的历史低点和每年131小时的飞行时间。该报告称，低比率远低于每个飞行员每周三架次和每年200小时的“健康战斗机阈值”。报告评估称，COVID对飞行小时和架次产生了严重影响，遗产组织指出，战斗机飞行员需要几年的训练才能恢复他们在2020年失去的东西。“不幸的是，空军没有走上这条道路，并将在2022财年从预算中削减87479个飞行小时--减少7%,”报告称。25年空军老兵、高级研究员约翰·维纳布尔（John“JV”Venable）告诉《空军》杂志，在第五代平台上购买第四代飞机使美国与同行竞争对手相比处于明显的劣势。“中国和俄罗斯不害怕第四代平台，”他说。“但他们确实害怕F-35。这很好地说明了我们现在应该买什么。“空军在2022年的预算请求中要求购买12架F-15EX，并在2022年的无资金优先事项清单中列入了另外12架F-15EX。然而，与传统的一个显著突破是，该服务在其2022年无资金优先事项清单中没有要求任何新的F-35攻击战斗机。维纳布尔说：“我们可以将这笔资金用于第五代战斗机部队，并在我们的资产能力方面向前推进。”空军和太空部队都无法立即回应对该报告调查结果发表评论的请求。太空部队不及格维纳布尔说，该报告根据老化和无保护的卫星、缺乏空间领域意识以及攻防能力不足，将这支成立2年的太空部队评为“薄弱”。“太空部队无法满足当前--更不用说未来--按需、作战和战术级别的战斗机需求，”报告称。维纳布尔说，总部位于马绍尔群岛的洛克希德·马丁雷达跟踪系统名为太空栅栏，于2020年上线，每两小时只提供约26000个物体运动的更新。“在这两个小时之间，这些平台的作用，那些卫星或导弹，……由于我们的星载和陆基监视平台的限制，我们不会知道这一点，”他说，并引用了最近的报道，即中国在8月份发射了一架具有核能力的高超音速滑翔飞行器穿越太空。维纳布尔说，太空部队需要雷达和卫星", "中文源标题": "传统基金会在新报告中将空军和太空军列为“弱”", "英文整编": "On October 20th, the American Heritage Foundation released the \"2022 American Military Index\", which divided the ratings into five levels: \"extremely strong\", \"strong\", \"medium\", \"weak\" and \"extremely weak\", and gave lower ratings to the US Air Force and the Space Army.The U.S. Air Force is rated as \"medium\" in terms of capability and strength, and \"weak\" in combat readiness and overall rating.

Their findings, published in npj Computational Materials, could lead to futuristic holographic displays, enhanced LiDAR sensors for reliable self-driving cars and better machine learning capabilities via all-optical neural networks.\nPioneered in the 1960s, photonics refers to the ability to harness, generate, detect and transmit fundamental light particles called photons and light waves. Since then, photonics has revolutionized fields like telecommunications, with fiber optic cables enabling the high-speed, high-bandwidth transfer of data even across great distances.\nTypically, photonics materials have fixed properties and cannot be tuned. However, phase change materials, which were originally developed for optical data storage purposes, can be programmed to have different optical properties, for example reflecting or absorbing.\nFor new photonics applications, more than two optical states are needed.

To the team's surprise, they found that Ge2Sb2Te5 exhibited growth-dominated crystallization instead of being governed by nucleation, and this effect is important because the optical response of photonics devices can be tuned to multiple optical levels via crystal growth.\nAs the first model of its kind to simulate multi-level phase change switching, the research team has made its code open source to encourage other researchers to develop and optimize other programmable photonics materials.\n\"Moving forward, we are also developing new PCMs that are transparent in the visible spectrum, instead of those that are non-transparent, such as Ge2Sb2Te5,\" concluded Assoc Prof Simpson. \"Transparency is key in enabling futuristic applications like holographic displays.\"\n", "中文原文": "受“生命游戏”的启发，SUTD的研究人员正在应用细胞自动化来高效地模拟具有多个光学相的相变材料，用于下一代光子学器件。新加坡科技与设计大学(SUTD)的研究人员设计了一种新颖的计算模型，可以准确预测光子学材料的性质，为下一代光子学器件铺平了道路。他们的发现发表在npj计算材料上，可能会导致未来全息显示器、用于可靠自动驾驶汽车的增强激光雷达传感器以及通过全光学神经网络实现更好的机器学习能力。光子学首创于20世纪60年代，是指利用、产生、探测和传输称为光子和光波的基本光粒子的能力。从那以后，光子学使电信等领域发生了革命性的变化，光纤电缆使数据的高速、高带宽传输成为可能，甚至跨越很远的距离。通常，光子学材料具有固定的性质，不能调谐。然而，相变材料最初是为光学数据存储目的而开发的，可以编程使其具有不同的光学性质，例如反射或吸收。对于新的光子学应用，需要两种以上的光学状态。然而，实现这样的条件说起来容易做起来难。“优化编程条件以创建不同的阶段是具有挑战性的、耗时的和乏味的，”来自SUTD工程产品开发支柱的研究负责人罗伯特·辛普森副教授说。在新冠肺炎爆发之前，Assoc教授辛普森分享说，他的团队一直在利用实验技术设计和开发具有两种或两种以上光学状态的光子学计算材料(PCM)。从已故数学家约翰·康威（John Conway）那里获得灵感，他在20世纪70年代设计了生命游戏，该团队试图探索细胞自动化如何帮助设计具有多个光学相位的PCMs。“细胞自动化是建立相互作用细胞模型的一种方法，”Assoc教授辛普森解释道。“当成千上万的细胞相互作用时，一个简单系统的集体行为变得复杂，有趣的模式出现。”因此，Assoc教授辛普森和他的同事使用细胞自动机模拟了PCM Ge2Sb2Te5在一定条件下的结晶过程。“我们表明，该模型准确地预测了部分转换PCM并产生广泛光学状态所需的激光脉冲，”他补充说。令人惊讶的是，他们发现Ge2Sb2Te5表现出生长主导的结晶，而不是由成核控制的，这种效应很重要，因为光子学器件的光学响应可以通过晶体生长调节到多个光学水平。作为同类模型中首个模拟多级相变开关的模型，研究团队将其代码开源，以鼓励其他研究人员开发和优化其他可编程光子学材料。Assoc教授辛普森总结说：“我们还在开发新的在可见光谱中透明的PCM，而不是那些不透明的PCM，如Ge2Sb2Te5。”“透明度是实现全息显示器等未来应用的关键.”", "中文源标题": "用细胞自动机推进光子学材料", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers from Singapore University of Science, Technology and Design (SUTD) have designed a novel computational model, which can use cellular automation to simulate the crystallization process of photonics computational material (PCM) Ge2Sb2Te5 under specific conditions.

Estimates even put it at more than 70%. However, in thermoelectric materials, such as those being studied at the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien, heat can be converted directly into electrical energy. This effect (the Seebeck effect) can be used in numerous applications in industry but also in everyday life.\nRecently, Ernst Bauer's research team made an exciting discovery in a thermoelectric material consisting of iron, vanadium and aluminum (Fe2VAl). The researchers recently published their results in Nature Communications.\nThe ideal thermoelectric\nTo achieve the greatest possible energy conversion effect, researchers are looking for materials that fulfill a number of characteristics: They should have a large Seebeck effect, high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. However, this is extremely difficult because these properties are interrelated and interdependent. Therefore, the researchers asked themselves what a material would have to look like physically in order to fulfill all these conditions in the best possible way.\nThus, physicists at TU Wien have succeeded in finding a new concept to resolve this contradiction and optimize all thermoelectric properties in one material at the same time. \"At the so-called Anderson transition, a quantum phase transition from localized to mobile electron states, the conditions for the ideal thermoelectric are met. This means that all conduction electrons have approximately the same energy,\" reports Fabian Garmroudi, first author of the study.\nThe Anderson transition occurs in semiconductors when impurity atoms are added, strongly binding their electrons. \"Analogous to ice floes in the sea, these are initially isolated from each other and cannot be stepped on. However, if the number of ice floes is large enough, you have a continuous connection through which you can cross the sea,\" Fabian Garmroudi draws a comparison. This happens in a similar way in solids: if the number of impurity atoms exceeds a critical value, the electrons can suddenly move freely from one atom to another and electricity can flow.\nAtoms swap places when it gets hot\nThe Anderson transition was demonstrated in close collaboration with researchers from Sweden and Japan as well as the University of Vienna, and was linked for the first time to a significant change in thermoelectric properties. The team made the exciting discovery when they heated the material to very high temperatures, close to the melting point.\n\"At high temperatures, the atoms vibrate so strongly that they occasionally swap their lattice positions. For example, iron atoms are then located where vanadium atoms were before. We succeeded in freezing this 'atomic confusion', which occurs at high temperatures, by so-called 'quenching', that is, rapid cooling in a water bath,\" reports Ernst Bauer. These irregular defects serve exactly the same purpose as the impurity atoms mentioned earlier, without the need to change the chemical composition of the material.\nEnergy conversion thanks to disorder\nIn many research areas of solid-state physics, one is interested in materials that are as pure as possible and have an ideal crystal structure. The reason: the regularity of the atoms simplifies a theoretical description of the physical properties. In the case of Fe2VAl, however, it is precisely the imperfections that account for most of the thermoelectric performance. It has also already been shown in neighboring disciplines that irregularities can be advantageous: \"Basic research on quantum materials is a good example of this. There, science has already been able to show that disorder is often the necessary spice in the 'quantum soup',\" says Andrej Pustogow, one of the co-authors. \"Now this concept has also arrived in applied solid-state research.\"\n", "中文原文": "在能量转换的过程中，大量的热量被损失掉了。估计甚至超过70%。然而，在热电材料中，例如在图文固体物理研究所正在研究的材料，热量可以直接转化为电能。这种效应（Seebeck效应）在工业和日常生活中都有广泛的应用。近日，恩斯特·鲍尔研究团队在一种由铁、钒、铝组成的热电材料(Fe2VAl)中有了令人兴奋的发现。研究人员最近在《自然通讯》上发表了他们的结果。理想热电为了实现最大可能的能量转换效果，研究人员正在寻找能够满足许多特性的材料：它们应该具有大Seebeck效应、高导电性和低导热性。然而，这是极其困难的，因为这些属性是相互关联和相互依赖的。因此，研究人员问自己，为了以最好的方式满足所有这些条件，一种材料在物理上应该是什么样子。因此，杜文的物理学家成功地找到了一个新的概念来解决这一矛盾，并同时优化一种材料的所有热电性能。该研究的第一作者法比安·加姆鲁迪（Fabian Garmroudi）报告说：“在所谓的安德森跃迁，即从局域电子态到移动电子态的量子相变时，满足了理想热电的条件。这意味着所有导电电子的能量大致相同。”当加入杂质原子时，在半导体中就会发生安德森跃迁，强烈地束缚了它们的电子。法比安·加姆鲁迪（Fabian Garmroudi）做了一个比较：“类似于海里的浮冰，这些浮冰最初是相互隔离的，不能踩到。然而，如果浮冰的数量足够大，你就有了一个连续的连接，通过它你可以穿越大海。”这在固体中以类似的方式发生：如果杂质原子的数量超过一个临界值，电子可以突然自由地从一个原子移动到另一个原子，电可以流动。当它变热时原子交换位置安德森跃迁是在与瑞典、日本以及维也纳大学的研究人员密切合作下证明的，并首次与热电性质的重大变化联系在一起。当他们把材料加热到非常高的温度，接近熔点时，该小组有了令人兴奋的发现。“在高温下，原子振动如此强烈，以至于它们偶尔会交换晶格位置。例如，铁原子位于钒原子之前所在的位置。恩斯特·鲍尔（Ernst Bauer）报告说：”我们通过所谓的‘淬火'，即在水浴中快速冷却，成功地冻结了这种在高温下发生的’原子混乱‘。“这些不规则缺陷的作用与前面提到的杂质原子完全相同，而不需要改变材料的化学成分。无序导致的能量转换在固体物理的许多研究领域中，人们对尽可能纯净并具有理想晶体结构的材料感兴趣。原因是：原子的规律性简化了对物理性质的理论描述。然而，在Fe2VAl的情况下，正是缺陷占了热电性能的大部分。邻近学科也已经表明，不规则性可能是有利的：“对量子材料的基础研究就是一个很好的例子。在那里，科学已经能够证明无序性通常是‘量子汤’中必要的调味品，”合著者之一安德烈·普斯托戈（Andrej Pustogow）说。“现在这个概念也到了应用固态研究中。”", "中文源标题": "热电：从热到电", "英文整编": "Recently, researchers from Vienna Technical University in Austria have successfully improved the performance of thermoelectric materials.

Therefore, based on electron transport and magnetization experiments, supported by Monte Carlo and density functional theory calculations, researchers proposed a new strategy to improve the performance of thermoelectric materials. They introduced a variable number of inverse defects through high temperature quenching control, which enabled them to realize Anderson transition in a single iron-aluminum alloy sample.

Andy Lazur and his team may have just the thing. Only it’s designed to run hot.\nLazur is the general manager of Pratt & Whitney’s research facility in Carlsbad, California, where the hottest things going are ceramic matrix composites, or CMCs. These revolutionary materials, comprising hundreds of thousands of fibers no thicker than one-tenth the diameter of a human hair, potentially offer huge benefits to components operating in the fierce heat of engines’ hot section. They also stand to extend those parts’ expected life span and boost fuel efficiency.\nCMCs will also play a key role in reducing emissions and extending on-wing time for both military and commercial engines, said Lazur. It’s another step forward in the commitment of Pratt & Whitney, a Raytheon Technologies business, to create a more sustainable global aviation industry.\n“Everybody’s looking at the climate crisis,” said Lazur, who joined Pratt & Whitney in 2017 and was appointed the Carlsbad site manager in 2019. “Rethinking aviation is part of our responsibility. We can be more responsible in terms of how much carbon we release into the environment.”\nAnd the environmental impact goes beyond fuel efficiency, said Lazur.\n“Let’s say a part can last 10,000 hours before replacement,” said Lazur. “If we can double that interval, it will reduce airline operating costs. If you can make a part last two or three years longer than metal parts, that also means less (discarded) material in the waste stream.”\nThe approach isn’t entirely new; carbon-carbon, a material related to CMCs, has existed since the 1970s and has been used by Collins Aerospace, another Raytheon Technologies business, to reduce weight, increase operating temperatures and improve durability. Pratt & Whitney is now focused on similar uses for CMCs in aviation engines – an idea supported by Pratt & Whitney’s research and development team.\nThe primary ceramic in Pratt & Whitney’s CMC is silicon carbide, a compound produced by the combination of one carbon atom and one silicon atom. Silicon carbide is very strong and maintains its strength at higher temperatures than metals. Silicon and carbon are both abundant on Earth, so there is potential for reducing material costs in the future. Once combined, the new material can absorb more heat and energy and offers more durability at lower total weights than traditional metals-based materials, such as nickel superalloys commonly used in aviation.\nThe tiny fibers used in CMCs are coated with a different ceramic material, which isolates fibers from cracks that can form in high-stress areas. This fiber coating is key to producing a ceramic that is much tougher than traditional ceramics – a key attribute for application in aircraft engines. CMC components are coated with an Environmental Barrier Coatings (EBC) that are also composed of ceramic materials. The coating is essential to protect the CMC structural component in the high-temperature combustion environment. Component failures are unacceptable and lengthy downtime for maintenance can be both highly disruptive and costly to customers’ operations, said Lazur.\nBeyond its R&D work, Lazur noted, the Carlsbad facility also serves as a test lab for Pratt & Whitney’s pursuit of a more sustainable workplace. For example, he explained, the Carlsbad location is developing an on-site heat reclamation system and pursuing on-site power generation to reduce its carbon footprint. The center employs 18 people and plans to expand to 60 by the end of 2023.\n“It’s a beautiful time to be at Pratt & Whitney,” said Lazur. “The question we must constantly ask ourselves is not only how do we make this technology, but how do we do it in a much more sustainable way?”\n", "中文原文": "在可持续航空领域寻找下一个酷的想法？安迪·拉祖尔和他的团队可能正好有这个东西。只是它的设计是热的。Lazur是普惠公司位于加利福尼亚州卡尔斯巴德的研究机构的总经理，那里最热门的东西是陶瓷基复合材料。这些革命性的材料由数十万根纤维组成，不到人类头发直径的十分之一，潜在地为在发动机高温区的酷热中工作的部件提供巨大的好处。它们还可以延长这些部件的预期寿命，提高燃料效率。Lazur说，CMCs还将在减少排放和延长军用和商用发动机的机翼时间方面发挥关键作用。这是雷神科技公司普惠承诺创造一个更可持续的全球航空业的又一步。“每个人都在关注气候危机，”拉祖尔说，他于2017年加入普惠公司，并于2019年被任命为卡尔斯巴德网站经理。“反思航空是我们责任的一部分。我们可以在向环境释放多少碳方面更负责任。“拉祖尔说，环境影响不仅仅是燃料效率。“假设一个零件在更换前可以持续10,000小时，”拉祖尔说。“如果我们能将这一间隔延长一倍，将降低航空公司的运营成本。如果你能让一个零件比金属零件寿命长两三年，这也意味着废物流中的（废弃）材料更少。“这种方法并不全新；carbon-carbon是一种与CMCs相关的材料，自20世纪70年代以来就已经存在，并被雷神技术公司的另一家业务柯林斯航空航天公司用于减轻重量、提高工作温度和提高耐久性。普惠公司现在正专注于CMC在航空发动机中的类似用途--这一想法得到了普惠公司研发团队的支持。普惠公司CMC的主要陶瓷是碳化硅，碳化硅是一种由一个碳原子和一个硅原子结合产生的化合物。碳化硅非常坚固，在比金属更高的温度下保持强度。硅和碳在地球上都很丰富，因此未来有降低材料成本的潜力。一旦结合起来，这种新材料可以吸收更多的热量和能量，并比传统的金属基材料（如航空中常用的镍高温合金）在总重量更低的情况下提供更高的耐久性。CMCs中使用的微小纤维被一种不同的陶瓷材料覆盖，这种材料将纤维与高应力区可能形成的裂纹隔离开来。这种纤维涂层是制造比传统陶瓷更坚韧的陶瓷的关键--这是应用于飞机发动机的关键属性。CMC组件涂有环境屏障涂层(EBC)，该涂层也由陶瓷材料组成。涂层对CMC结构件在高温燃烧环境中的保护至关重要。Lazur说，组件故障是不可接受的，长时间的维修停机可能会对客户的运营造成高度破坏性和昂贵的成本。Lazur指出，除了研发工作，卡尔斯巴德工厂也是普惠追求更可持续工作场所的测试实验室。例如，他解释说，卡尔斯巴德的位置正在开发一个现场热回收系统，并追求现场发电，以减少其碳足迹。该中心现有员工18人，计划到2023年底扩大到60人。“这是在普惠的美好时光，”拉祖尔说。“我们必须不断问自己的问题不仅是我们如何制造这项技术，而且是如何以更可持续的方式进行？”", "中文源标题": "CMCs为更轻、更耐用的发动机部件提供燃烧平台", "英文整编": "Pratt & Whitney (P&W) is focusing on developing ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), which aims to provide protection for high temperature components in engine hot zone, and can also extend the life expectancy of these components and improve fuel efficiency.If the time interval for parts replacement can be doubled, the operating costs of airlines can be greatly reduced; If the life of parts can be extended by two or three years, the waste materials will be greatly reduced.

It was only as a last resort that he had even tried burying microscopic magnetic dots in hardened chunks of sugar — hard candy, basically — and sending these sweet packages to colleagues in a biomedical lab. The sugar dissolves easily in water, freeing the magnetic dots for their studies without leaving any harmful plastics or chemicals behind. \nBy chance, Zabow had left one of these sugar pieces, embedded with arrays of micromagnetic dots, in a beaker, and it did what sugar does with time and heat — it melted, coating the bottom of the beaker in a gooey mess. \n“No problem,” he thought. He would just dissolve away the sugar, as normal. Except this time when he rinsed out the beaker, the microdots were gone. But they weren’t really missing; instead of releasing into the water, they had been transferred onto the bottom of the glass where they were casting a rainbow reflection. \n“It was those rainbow colors that really surprised me,” Zabow recalls. The colors indicated that the arrays of microdots had retained their unique pattern.\nThis sweet mess gave him an idea. Could regular table sugar be used to bring the power of microchips to new and unconventional surfaces? Zabow’s findings on this potential transfer printing process were published in Science in its Nov. 25 issue.\nSemiconductor chips, micropatterned surfaces, and electronics all rely on microprinting, the process of putting precise but minuscule patterns millionths to billionths of a meter wide onto surfaces to give them new properties. Traditionally, these tiny mazes of metals and other materials are printed on flat wafers of silicon. But as the possibilities for semiconductor chips and smart materials expand, these intricate, tiny patterns need to be printed on new, unconventional, non-flat surfaces. \nDirectly printing these patterns on such surfaces is tricky, so scientists transfer prints. There are flexible tapes and plastics that can do the job (like using putty to pick up newsprint), but these solids can still have trouble conforming to sharp curves and corners when the print is laid back down. They could also leave behind plastics or other chemicals that could be hard to remove or be unsafe for biomedical uses. \nThere are liquid techniques, where the transfer material is floated on the surface of water and the target surface is pushed through it. But that can be tricky too; with a freely flowing liquid it can be hard to place the print precisely where you want it on a new surface. \nBut, as Zabow discovered to his surprise, a simple combination of caramelized sugar and corn syrup can do the trick. \nWhen dissolved in a small amount of water, this sugar mixture can be poured over micropatterns on a flat surface. Once the water evaporates, the candy hardens and can be lifted away with the pattern embedded. The candy with the print is then placed over the new surface and melted. The sugar/corn syrup combination maintains a high viscosity as it melts, letting the pattern maintain its arrangement as it flows over curves and edges. Then, using water, the sugar can be washed away, leaving just the pattern behind.\nUsing this technique, called REFLEX (REflow-driven FLExible Xfer), microcircuit patterns could be transferred like a stencil to allow scientists or manufacturers to etch and fill the materials they need in the right places. Or, patterned materials could be transferred from their original chip onto fibers or microbeads for potential biomedical or microrobotics studies, or over sharp or curved surfaces within new devices. \nThe technique proved successful for a large range of surfaces, including printing onto the sharp point of a pin, and writing the word “NIST” in microscale gold lettering onto a single strand of human hair. In another example, 1-micrometer-diameter magnetic disks were successfully transferred onto a floss fiber of a milkweed seed. In the presence of a magnet, the magnetically printed fiber reacted, showing the transfer had worked. \nThere’s still more to explore with REFLEX, but this process could open new possibilities for new materials and microstructures across fields from electronics to optics to biomedical engineering.\n“The semiconductor industry has spent billions of dollars perfecting the printing techniques to create chips we rely on,” Zabow says. “Wouldn’t it be nice if we could leverage some of those technologies, expanding the reach of those prints with something as simple and inexpensive as a piece of candy?”\n", "中文原文": "NIST科学家加里·扎博从未打算在他的实验室里使用糖果。在最后的手段下，他甚至尝试将微小的磁性点埋在硬化的糖块中--基本上是硬糖--并将这些甜蜜的包裹发送给生物医学实验室的同事。糖很容易溶于水，为他们的研究释放磁性点，而不会留下任何有害的塑料或化学物质。一次偶然的机会，Zabow把其中一个嵌有微磁点阵列的糖块留在了烧杯里，它和糖一样随着时间和温度融化，烧杯底部被粘糊糊的。“没问题，”他想。他会像往常一样把糖溶解掉。除了这次他冲洗烧杯时，微点不见了。但他们并没有真的失踪；它们没有释放到水中，而是被转移到玻璃底部，在那里它们投下了彩虹反射。“是那些彩虹色真的让我惊讶，”扎博回忆道。这些颜色表明微点阵列保留了它们独特的图案。这种甜蜜的混乱给了他一个主意。普通的食糖可以用来将微芯片的力量带到新的非常规表面吗？Zabow关于这种潜在转移印刷过程的发现发表在11月25日的《科学》杂志上。半导体芯片、微图案表面和电子学都依赖于微印刷，即在表面上放置百万分之一到十亿分之一米宽的精确但微小的图案，以赋予它们新的性能的过程。传统上，这些金属和其他材料的微小迷宫印刷在平坦的硅晶圆上。但随着半导体芯片和智能材料可能性的扩大，这些复杂的微小图案需要印刷在新的、非传统的、非平坦的表面上。直接在这样的表面上打印这些图案是很棘手的，所以科学家转移印刷品。有柔性胶带和塑料可以完成这项工作（就像用腻子拿起新闻纸一样），但当印刷品放回原处时，这些固体仍然很难符合尖锐的曲线和角。它们还可能留下塑料或其他化学物质，这些物质可能很难去除，或者对生物医学用途不安全。有液体技术，转移材料漂浮在水面上，目标表面被推动通过。但这也可能很棘手；在自由流动的液体中，很难将印刷物精确地放置在新表面上所需的位置。但是，正如扎博惊讶地发现的那样，焦糖和玉米糖浆的简单组合就可以做到这一点。当溶解在少量水中时，这种糖混合物可以浇注在平坦表面的微图案上。一旦水分蒸发，糖果就会变硬，可以随着图案的嵌入而被提起。然后将带有印花的糖果放在新的表面上并融化。糖/玉米糖浆组合在融化时保持高粘度，让图案在曲线和边缘流动时保持其排列。然后，用水，糖可以被冲走，只留下图案。使用这种被称为REflow驱动柔性Xfer的技术，微电路模式可以像模板一样转移，让科学家或制造商在正确的地方蚀刻和填充他们需要的材料。或者，图案化的材料可以从原来的芯片转移到纤维或微珠上，用于潜在的生物医学或微机器人研究，或者在新设备的尖锐或弯曲表面上。这项技术被证明在很多表面上都是成功的，包括在大头针的尖点上打印，以及在一根人的头发上用微型金色字母写上“NIST”。在另一个例子中，1微米直径的磁盘被成功地转移到马利筋种子的牙线纤维上。在磁铁的存在下，磁性印刷的纤维发生反应，表明转移已经起作用。反射还有更多需要探索，但这一过程可以为新材料和微结构打开新的可能性，跨越从电子学到光学到生物医学工程的各个领域。“半导体行业已经花费了数十亿美元来完善印刷技术，以创造我们所依赖的芯片，”扎博说。“如果我们能够利用其中的一些技术，用一块糖果这样简单廉价的东西来扩大这些指纹的覆盖面，难道不是很好吗？”", "中文源标题": "NIST发现了一种在曲线表面打印微芯片图案的新方法", "英文整编": "Recently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States has developed a method of transferring sugar mixture on arbitrary common curved surface, which provides new possibilities for opening up new materials and microstructures in the fields of electronics, optics and biomedical engineering.

Glen VanHerck, the head of US Northern Command, is pushing the Defense Department to rapidly adopt the use of artificial intelligence tools that would give decision-makers earlier, and better, options — not just for defeating an adversary on the battlefield, but for actually avoiding warfare in the first place.\nIn an exclusive interview this week, VanHerck said AI could help military commanders, US diplomats, allies and partner nations all formulate comprehensive strategies for deterring adversarial global powers, such as Russia and China, in what DoD calls the “gray zone,” also sometimes referred to as the “competition phase” or “left of conflict.”\n“It creates options for multiple levers of influence, to be able to coordinate in near real-time to develop global, all-domain dilemmas [for adversaries] to get to deterrence,” said VanHerck, who in his position as NORTHCOM and NORAD head is responsible for defense of the homeland, where obviously the US military would prefer not to have to fight.\nAs such, “deterrence” is at the center of his mission — and of a series of trials, dubbed Global Information Dominance Experiments (GIDEs) designed as a spur for moving AI capabilities into the hands of commanders as soon as possible.\n“What I really want to get out of this is to show the value of data and information, when applied across a global problem set, an all-domain problem set, and how quickly you can generate global dilemmas [for adversaries and], global options for our senior leaders … to create that deterrence we talked about, or de-escalation options, or even in conflict, defeat options,” he said.\nOnce the final results of NORTHCOM’s third Global Information Dominance Experiment (GIDE 3), which began July 8 and wrapped up today, are in hand, he intends to take his case that AI decision tools are both ready now and urgently needed by Combatant Commanders to both Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Hyten, who also chairs the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).\nThe timing is notable, as the JROC is in the midst of developing cross-service requirements to implement DoD’s new Joint Warfighting Concept (JWC) and the related Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) strategy.\n“You know, I’m not a service chief. I don’t have acquisition authority,” the four-star Air Force general said. “Ideally, I can hand this off to somebody in the department to move it forward for future fielding, sustainment, modernization, etc.” But for that to happen, he added, there has to be a cultural shift and “agreement to not use legacy processes and systems to field these kind of capabilities.”\n“And, so the way forward, to be honest, I don’t know exactly what that is,” VanHerck admitted. “We’ll figure that out here real soon after GIDE 3, and I’ll talk to the deputy secretary of defense and the vice chairman on the way forward. But I plan to keep going, and keep applying these capabilities to show what’s available now, and to change culture.”\nGIDE 3\nThe GIDE series, as Breaking Defense reported exclusively in in March, are virtual experiments testing software-based decision aids developed for NORTHCOM that use artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) software to speed commanders’ ability to act. Those same tools — a radar-integration tool; an “information dominance” tool to amalgamate various sensor and even social media inputs; and a “cross-command collaboration” tool that creates a virtual 3D battlefield — were being further refined in GIDE 3.\nGIDE 3 was based on a three-phase scenario, beginning in the pre-conflict stage with a peer adversary, that put a heavy focus on managing “contested logistics” — one of the key tenets of the JWC. All 11 Combatant Commands participated in the exercise, and representatives from a couple of allied countries were involved as observers.\nIn future global warfare with peers, VanHerck explained, “our way of producing power and projecting power will be challenged as we flow forces — whether those forces be through surface vessels, whether they be through air — they will be challenged especially non-kinetically.”\n“What this gives us — and what GIDE 3 has already demonstrated — is the ability to rapidly assess the situation to take action when something changes for logistics, where you’re contested,” he went on. “So, say, for example, the Panama Canal became not available. It enables, really quickly, Combatant Commanders to talk about the impact of that, to create options for countering that non-availability, and gives us the ability to assess the risk very quickly of whatever contested logistics impact that you may have.”\nPolicy Impact\nBut, VanHerck stressed, the extra time that using machine-speed data crunching to develop a clear picture of adversary activities running up to a potential conflict would be just as important for US policy-makers as for military commanders in the heat of battle.\n“Let’s just give you a hypothetical scenario, like that in March, when Russia came down towards the Ukraine and set up their thousands of forces. Let’s just say that you were able to detect that, through the use of the combination of military GEOINT satellites, commercial satellites, signals intelligence, the use of publicly available information such as social media … those kinds of things, and you were able to get three additional days of notification,” he elaborated.\n“So, if you’re able to do that before they actually move and get into position, think about the decision space that you now have to give to diplomats — or to give to allies and partners — to posture or to negotiate.”\nBecause the US didn’t have the ability to gather all that information, rapidly synthesize it and then just as rapidly distribute it during Russia’s March shenanigans, Washington’s response was “reactive, not proactive,” VanHerck said. “Having machines and artificial intelligence … we can collaborate on options to deter, and whether that be State, whether that be DoD, it doesn’t matter, whether it be a partner or an ally.”\nIntegrated Deterrence\nVanHerck further explained that his push for widespread use of AI as a tool for improved decision-making is “100 percent” in alignment with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s pursuit of what DoD now is calling “integrated deterrence.”\n“I’m so glad that he is going down an integrated deterrence plan, because deterrence is absolutely integrated with allies, partners, all levers of national power and integrated across all Combatant Commands,” VanHerck said. “That’s what I’m after in this capability. Once you field it, it gives us the ability to create that decision space and create that integrated deterrence.”\nIn a speech Tuesday at the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NACAI), Austin explained that the concept is about “using the right mix of technology, operational concepts, and capabilities — all woven together in a networked way that is so credible, flexible, and formidable that it will give any adversary pause.”\nFurther, Austin said, integrated deterrence involves working even more closely with allies and partners — including on the ethical use of AI as a “force multiplier.”\n“Used right, AI capabilities can play a critical role in all four areas of the Joint Warfighting Concept that I approved this spring, including Joint Fires, Joint All Domain Command and Control, Contested Logistics, and Information Advantage,” he said in his written remarks. “Today, across the Department, we have more than 600 AI efforts in progress… significantly more than just a year ago.”\n", "中文原文": "特蕾莎·希钦森2021年7月15日下午2:23NORTHCOM的全球信息优势实验3（GIDE 3）测试指挥官的人工智能决策辅助工具于7月8日至15日进行华盛顿：美国北方司令部司令格伦·范赫克将军正在推动国防部迅速采用人工智能工具，这将为决策者提供更早、更好的选择--不仅是为了在战场上击败对手，而且是为了首先避免战争。在本周的一次独家采访中，范赫克表示，人工智能可以帮助军事指挥官、美国外交官、盟友和伙伴国家制定全面的战略，在国防部所说的“灰色地带”，有时也被称为“竞争阶段”或“冲突左翼”，威慑俄罗斯和中国等敌对的全球大国。范赫克说：“这为多个影响力杠杆创造了选择，能够近乎实时地协调，以发展全球、全领域的困境（对手），从而达到威慑。”范赫克担任诺斯康和北美防空司令部负责人，负责国土防御，显然美国军方不希望在那里作战。因此，“威慑”是他任务的核心--也是一系列试验的核心，这些试验被称为全球信息优势实验(GIDEs)，旨在刺激尽快将人工智能能力转移到指挥官手中。他说：“我真正想从中得到的是，展示数据和信息的价值，当应用于全球问题集、全领域问题集时，以及你能多快地（为对手和）为我们的高级领导人产生全球困境、全球选择……以建立我们谈到的威慑，或降级选择，甚至在冲突中，失败选择。”诺思康公司的第三次全球信息优势实验（GIDE 3）于7月8日开始，今天结束，一旦最终结果出来，他打算向国防部副部长凯瑟琳·希克斯和参谋长联席会议副主席约翰·海滕将军提出他的观点，即人工智能决策工具现在已经准备好，战斗指挥官迫切需要人工智能决策工具，约翰·海滕将军也是联合需求监督委员会(JROC)的主席。时机值得注意，因为JROC正在开发跨军种需求，以实施国防部的新联合作战概念(JWC)和相关的联合全域指挥和控制(JADC2)战略。“你知道，我不是服务主任。我没有获取权限，“四星空军将军说。“理想情况下，我可以把这个交给部门中的某人，为未来的部署、维持、现代化等推进它。”但他补充说，要做到这一点，必须有一个文化转变，并“同意不使用遗留过程和系统来发挥这种能力。”“老实说，前进的道路是什么，我不知道到底是什么，”范赫克承认。“在纪德3号之后，我们将很快在这里解决这个问题，我将与国防部副部长和副主席就前进的道路进行交谈。但我计划继续前进，继续应用这些能力来展示现在可用的东西，并改变文化。“纪德3Breaking Defense在3月份独家报道的GIDE系列是为NORTHCOM开发的基于软件的决策辅助工具的虚拟实验，该辅助工具使用人工智能/机器学习（AI/ML）软件来加快指挥官的行动能力。同样的工具--雷达整合工具；一个“信息主导”工具，可以融合各种传感器甚至社交媒体输入；和一个创建虚拟3D战场的“跨命令协作”工具--在GIDE 3中被进一步完善。GIDE 3是基于三阶段的设想，从冲突前阶段开始，与同行对手，重点放在管理“有争议的后勤”上--这是联合世界委员会的关键原则之一。所有11个作战司令部都参加了演习，几个盟国的代表作为观察员参加了演习。范赫克解释说，在未来与同行的全球战争中，“我们生产力量和投射力量的方式将受到挑战，因为我们流动力量--无论这些力量是通过水面舰艇，还是通过空气--它们将受到特别是非动力学的挑战。”“这给了我们--以及GIDE 3已经展示的--是当物流发生变化时，在你有争议的地方，快速评估局势并采取行动的能力，”他继续说道。“所以，比如说，巴拿马运河变得不可用。它使战斗指挥官能够很快地谈论这一影响，为应对这种不可用性创造选择，并使我们能够很快评估你可能有的任何有争议的后勤影响的风险。“政策影响但是，范赫克强调，使用机器速度的数据处理来开发一个清晰的图像的额外时间", "中文源标题": "独家：NORTHCOM负责人向国防部领导人施压，要求提供人工智能工具", "英文整编": "From July 8 to 15, 2021, the US Northern Command conducted the 3rd Global Information Domination Experiment (GIDE3), which tested and used various decision-making AIDS based on artificial intelligence/machine learning to improve commanders' operational capabilities.

These materials show great promise for soft robotics, smart biomedical devices and deployable space structures, but until now they haven't been able to store enough energy. Now, researchers reporting in ACS Central Science have developed a shape memory polymer that stores almost six times more energy than previous versions.\nShape memory polymers alternate between an original, undeformed state and a secondary, deformed state. The deformed state is created by stretching the polymer and is held in place by molecular changes, such as dynamic bonding networks or strain-induced crystallization, that are reversed with heat or light. The polymer then returns to its original state through the release of stored entropic energy. But it's been challenging for scientists to make these polymers perform energy-intensive tasks. Zhenan Bao and colleagues wanted to develop a new type of shape memory polymer that stretches into a stable, highly elongated state, allowing it to release large amounts of energy when returning to its original state.\nThe researchers incorporated 4-,4'-methylene bisphenylurea units into a poly(propylene glycol) polymer backbone. In the polymer's original state, polymer chains were tangled and disordered. Stretching caused the chains to align and form hydrogen bonds between urea groups, creating supermolecular structures that stabilized the highly elongated state. Heating caused the bonds to break and the polymer to contract to its initial, disordered state.\nIn tests, the polymer could be stretched up to five times its original length and store up to 17.9 J/g energy -- almost six times more energy than previous shape memory polymers. The team demonstrated that the stretched material could use this energy to lift objects 5,000 times its own weight upon heating. They also made an artificial muscle by attaching the pre-stretched polymer to the upper and lower arm of a wooden mannequin.

The effort will showcase advanced capabilities that could improve future GPS satellites or inform a new program to augment today’s constellation. Those technologies include steerable beams to provide regional coverage, a reprogrammable payload that can receive upgrades on orbit and protections against signal jamming.\nSpeaking with reporters during a recent visit to the Space Vehicles Directorate at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, NTS-3 program manager Arlen Biersgreen said the effort is part of a legacy of experimental positioning, navigation and timing, or PNT, missions that have shaped key military and civilian space technology.\nThe last NTS satellite flew in 1977 and showcased capabilities that proved integral to the GPS program. Biersgreen said the goal is for NTS-3 to create a pathway for a more regular demonstration cadence.\n“The whole team has a vision for this not to be the last NTS in the near future,” he said. “The reality is — because of the threats GPS is experiencing and because of the importance that it has to military and civilian operations all over the world — we’ve got to have a faster cycle to keep up with the threats as they develop.”\nIn preparation for the 2023 launch, Biersgreen and his team expect to finish integrating and testing the spacecraft’s hardware and software this fall in time to deliver the satellite by the end of the year. The program recently completed key tests of major hardware and software components, including antenna arrays and the command-and-control system for the satellite bus and payload.\nFor the program’s ground segment, which will operate NTS-3 once on orbit, the team is eyeing integrated testing this fall and has ordered the hardware for its eventual mission operations center. In the meantime, the program has set up a mock-mission operations center for training and to ensure the various interfaces and systems work together. Once the real mission operations center is completed later this year, Biersgreen said, the team will use it for a factory compatibility test that will demonstrate functionality between the ground system and the spacecraft.\nThe program is also developing NTS-3 ground receivers, which allow military users to tap into the satellite’s advanced PNT capabilities. To date, the team has built four receivers and plans to provide six for the NTS-3 experiment.\nBiersgreen said the program office is also eyeing opportunities to validate NTS-3′s performance during exercises with the military services. For example, the team had a chance to validate the receivers’ performance in a Navy exercise in March called NAVFEST, which is held annually at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. And in August, NTS-3 will be a part of the Army’s yearly PNT Assessment Exercise, or PNTAX.\nDuring PNTAX, program officials wants to observe how the system works in a real-world environment and identify any necessary changes. The exercise also provides a chance to measure the satellite’s anti-jam capability, giving the Air Force Research Lab a “more convincing example of the utility of the techniques that we’re demonstrating,” Biersgreen said.\nOnce on orbit, NTS-3 will spend its first year performing more than 100 experiments, which will test various technologies and techniques. When the formal demonstration phase is complete, the satellite will continue to provide data for about two years.\nAs the lab plans for the experiment, acquisition offices within the Space Force and the Air Force are preparing strategies to buy and field the new technology. The Space Force is in the midst of a force design study that could drive changes to its current PNT architecture, and the serivce closely watching NTS-3 to see how it might augment GPS satellites.\nThe Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is particularly interested in the user equipment segment of the program and is making plans to take advantage of the program’s software architecture.\n“We’re working closely with our mission partners so that the data coming out of the experiment is relevant for transition across space, ground and user segments,” Biersgreen said.\n", "中文原文": "新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基--随着美国太空部队准备发射近50年来第一次主要的定位、导航和定时演示，空军研究实验室空间飞行器局正在加大实验性导航卫星的集成和测试活动。该实验室有望在2023年底发射第三颗导航技术卫星，或NTS-3，由主承包商L3Harris Technologies建造。这项工作将展示先进的能力，可以改善未来的GPS卫星或为新的计划提供信息，以扩大今天的星座。这些技术包括提供区域覆盖的可操纵波束、可在轨道上接收升级的可重新编程有效载荷以及防止信号干扰。NTS-3项目经理阿伦·比尔斯格林（Arlen Biersgreen）最近在访问新墨西哥州柯特兰空军基地的空间飞行器管理局时对记者说，这项努力是实验性定位、导航和定时任务遗产的一部分，这些任务塑造了关键的军用和民用空间技术。最后一颗NTS卫星在1977年飞行，展示了被证明是GPS计划不可或缺的能力。Biersgreen说，NTS-3的目标是为更有规律的演示节奏创造一条途径。“整个团队都有一个愿景，在不久的将来，这不是最后一个NTS，”他说。“现实是--由于全科医生正在经历的威胁，也由于它对世界各地军事和民事行动的重要性--我们必须有一个更快的周期来跟上威胁的发展。”为了为2023年的发射做准备，比尔斯格林和他的团队预计将在今年秋天及时完成航天器硬件和软件的集成和测试，以便在年底交付卫星。该计划最近完成了主要硬件和软件组件的关键测试，包括天线阵列和卫星总线和有效载荷的指挥和控制系统。对于该计划的地面部分，NTS-3将在轨道上运行一次，该小组着眼于今年秋天的综合测试，并为其最终的任务操作中心订购了硬件。与此同时，该方案还建立了一个模拟任务操作中心进行培训，并确保各种接口和系统协同工作。比尔斯格林说，一旦今年晚些时候真正的任务操作中心完成，该团队将使用它进行工厂兼容性测试，以展示地面系统和航天器之间的功能。该项目还在开发NTS-3地面接收器，允许军事用户利用卫星的先进PNT能力。到目前为止，该小组已经建造了四个接收器，并计划为NTS-3实验提供六个。比尔斯格林说，项目办公室也在寻找机会，在与军队的演习中验证NTS-3的性能。例如，该团队有机会在3月份的海军演习中验证接收器的性能，该演习每年在新墨西哥州白沙导弹靶场举行。8月，NTS-3将成为陆军年度PNT评估演习的一部分，或称PNTAX。在PNTAX期间，项目官员希望观察该系统在现实环境中的工作方式，并确定任何必要的变化。比尔斯格林说，这次演习还提供了一个衡量卫星抗干扰能力的机会，给空军研究实验室一个“更令人信服的例子，说明我们正在演示的技术的效用”。一旦进入轨道，NTS-3将在第一年进行100多项实验，这些实验将测试各种技术和技巧。当正式演示阶段完成时，卫星将继续提供约两年的数据。随着实验室计划进行实验，太空部队和空军的采购办公室正在准备购买和部署新技术的策略。太空部队正在进行一项力量设计研究，这可能会推动其目前的PNT架构的变化，序列密切关注NTS-3，看看它如何增强GPS卫星。空军生命周期管理中心对该计划的用户设备部分特别感兴趣，并正在制定计划，利用该计划的软件架构。比尔斯格林说：“我们正在与我们的任务伙伴密切合作，以便实验得出的数据与空间、地面和用户段的过渡相关。”", "中文源标题": "空军研究实验室开始整合，试验导航卫星测试", "英文整编": "As the US Space Force prepares to launch the first satellite for positioning, navigation and timing demonstration in the past 50 years, the Spacecraft Council of the US Air Force Research Laboratory is carrying out integration and testing activities of navigation satellites.The laboratory is expected to launch the third navigation technology satellite (NTS-3) developed by the main contractor L3Harris Technology Company by the end of 2023.

The IEA said the global energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure future.\nIEA Executive Director Fatih Birol (centre) at the launch of WEO2022, flanked by lead authors Laura Cozzi (right) and Tim Gould (left)\nThe global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing profound and long-lasting changes that have the potential to hasten the transition to a more sustainable and secure energy system, according to the IEA. \"Today's energy crisis is delivering a shock of unprecedented breadth and complexity,\" it said.\n\"Energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come,\" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \"Even with today's policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy system.\"\nThe WEO's Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) sets out what needs to be done to move beyond announced pledges towards a trajectory that would reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050. As well as this scenario, the WEO 2022 explores two others: the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), representing a path based on the energy and climate measures governments have actually put in place to date, as well as specific policy initiatives that are under development; and the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which maps out a path in which the net zero emissions pledges announced by governments so far are implemented in time and in full.\n\"For the first time ever, a WEO scenario based on today's prevailing policy settings - in this case, the Stated Policies Scenario - has global demand for every fossil fuel exhibiting a peak or plateau,\" the IEA said. In this scenario, there is a reduction in the use of coal within the next few years, natural gas demand reaches a plateau by the end of the decade, and rising sales of electric vehicles mean that oil demand levels off in the mid-2030s before ebbing slightly to mid-century. The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix in STEPS falls from around 80% to just above 60% by 2050. The declines are much faster and more pronounced in the WEO's more climate-focused scenarios.\nGrowth in nuclear capacity\nIn the STEPS scenario, global nuclear output increases from 2776 TWh in 2021 to 3351 TWh in 2030 and to 4260 TWh in 2050. However, nuclear maintains its current share of about 10% in total electricity generation. This scenario requires the completion of 120 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2030, as well as the addition of another 300 GW worth of new reactors between 2030 and 2050 in over 30 countries.\nIn the APS scenario, around 18 GW of new nuclear capacity is added per year over the outlook period, over a quarter more than in the STEPS, but the higher level of electricity demand in this scenario means that the nuclear share of the electricity supply mix remains about 10%. In APS, nuclear generation increases to 3547 TWh in 2030 and to 5103 TWh in 2050.\nIn the NZE scenario, lifetime extensions in the 2020s helps limit global emissions, and an average of 24 GW of capacity added each year between 2022 and 2050 more than doubles nuclear power capacity by 2050. In this scenario, nuclear generation increases to 3896 TWh in 2030 and to 5810 TWh in 2050. However, nuclear's share of the electricity mix declines to 8% in 2050 due to very strong growth in electricity demand in the NZE scenario.\nThe IEA notes that while clean energy investment rises above USD2 trillion by 2030 in STEPS, it would need to be above USD4 trillion by the same date in the NZE scenario. \"Major international efforts are still urgently required to narrow the worrying divide in clean energy investment levels between advanced economies and emerging and developing economies,\" it added.\n\"The continued role of nuclear power in the electricity sector relies on decisions to extend the lifetime of existing reactors and the success of programmes to build new ones,\" the IEA said. However, it noted that investment in nuclear power is \"coming back into favour\" in some countries. \"There have been announcements of lifetime extensions for existing reactors, often as part of the response to the current crisis ... there is growing interest in the potential for small modular reactors to contribute to emissions reductions and power system reliability\".\nCommenting on the latest WEO, World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León said: \"Nuclear is a cornerstone of the IEA's vision of a clean energy future. But nuclear energy has the potential to do much more than what the IEA sets out. A greater contribution from nuclear will be needed because nuclear has the potential to supply both electricity and heat, both of which will be vital to achieving full decarbonisation across all sectors.\"\nShe added: \"Nuclear energy is a proven technology with many economic, social and environmental advantages. A sound and sustainable clean energy future will need to make much greater use of its benefits.\"\nReduced CO2 emissions\nIn its STEPS scenario, the IEA sees global CO2 emissions reaching a high point of 37 billion tonnes per year in 2025 before gradually reducing to 32 billion tonnes by 2050. It said this would be associated with a rise of around 2.5°C in global average temperatures by 2100, \"far from enough to avoid severe climate change impacts\". Full achievement of all climate pledges would move the world towards safer ground, but there is still a large gap between today's pledges and a stabilisation of the rise in global temperatures around 1.5°C.\nIn APS, emissions peak in the mid-2020s and fall to 12 billion tonnes in 2050, resulting in a projected global median temperature rise in 2100 of 1.7°C. In NZE, CO2 emissions fall to 23 billion tonnes in 2030 and to zero in 2050, a trajectory consistent with limiting the temperature increase to less than 1.5°C in 2100.\nPublication of the latest WEO came as the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released its Emissions Gap Report 2022, which shows that under current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the world is headed for 2.8°C of global heating by the end of the century. Despite a call for strengthened NDCs for 2030, UNEP's report finds that progress since COP26 in Glasgow last year has been inadequate.\n\"Amid the major changes taking place, a new energy security paradigm is needed to ensure reliability and affordability while reducing emissions,\" Birol said. \"That is why this year's WEO provides 10 principles that can help guide policymakers through the period when declining fossil fuel and expanding clean energy systems co-exist, since both systems are required to function well during energy transitions in order to deliver the energy services needed by consumers.\n\"And as the world moves on from today's energy crisis, it needs to avoid new vulnerabilities arising from high and volatile critical mineral prices or highly concentrated clean energy supply chains.\"\n", "中文原文": "2022年10月27日国际能源署(IEA)在其最新的《世界能源展望》(WEO)中预测，到2050年，核能发电量将增加一倍以上，至少有30个国家将增加对核能的使用，这是到2050年净零排放的设想。国际能源署表示，全球能源危机可能是迈向更清洁、更安全未来的历史性转折点。IEA执行主任法蒂赫·比罗尔（中）在2022年WEO2022的发布会上，主要作者劳拉·科齐（右）和蒂姆·古尔德（左）在旁边国际能源署表示，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰引发的全球能源危机正在造成深刻而持久的变化，有可能加快向更可持续和更安全的能源系统过渡。“今天的能源危机正在带来前所未有的广度和复杂性的冲击，”它说。IEA执行董事法蒂赫·比罗尔（Fatih Birol）表示：“由于俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，能源市场和政策发生了变化，不仅是暂时的，而且是未来几十年的。”“即使在今天的政策背景下，能源世界正在我们眼前发生巨大变化。世界各地政府的回应承诺将使这成为一个历史性的决定性转折点，走向一个更清洁、更负担得起、更安全的能源系统。”WEO的到2050年净零排放设想(NZE)阐述了需要做些什么来超越宣布的承诺，走向到2050年实现全球净零排放的轨道。除了这一设想方案，2022年WEO还探讨了另外两个设想方案：既定政策设想方案(STEPS)，代表了一条基于各国政府迄今实际采取的能源和气候措施以及正在制定的具体政策举措的道路；以及宣布的承诺情景(APS)，该情景描绘了各国政府迄今宣布的净零排放承诺得到及时和充分执行的路径。国际能源署表示：“有史以来第一次，基于当今普遍政策设置的WEO场景--在这种情况下，是既定政策场景--全球对每种化石燃料的需求都出现了峰值或平台期。”在这种情况下，未来几年内煤炭的使用将会减少，天然气需求将在本十年末达到稳定水平，电动汽车销量的上升意味着石油需求将在21世纪30年代中期持平，然后在本世纪中叶略有下降。到2050年，化石燃料在全球能源结构中的份额将从80%左右逐步下降到60%以上。在WEO更关注气候的情况下，下降速度更快，也更明显。核能力增长在STEPS方案中，全球核产量将从2021年的2776 TWh增加到2030年的3351 TWh和2050年的4260 TWh。然而，核能仍保持其目前在总发电量中约10%的份额。这一设想要求到2030年完成120吉瓦的新核能力，并在2030年至2050年期间在30多个国家再增加价值300吉瓦的新反应堆。在APS方案中，在展望期内每年增加约18吉瓦的新核能力，比STEPS方案多四分之一以上，但这一方案中较高的电力需求水平意味着核能在电力供应组合中的份额仍约为10%。在APS，核能发电量在2030年增加到3547兆瓦时，在2050年增加到5103兆瓦时。在NZE方案中，2020年代的寿命延长有助于限制全球排放，2022年至2050年间每年平均增加24吉瓦的容量，到2050年将使核电容量翻一番多。在这种情况下，核能发电量在2030年增加到3896兆瓦时，在2050年增加到5810兆瓦时。然而，由于NZE方案中电力需求的强劲增长，核能在电力组合中的份额在2050年下降到8%。IEA指出，虽然清洁能源投资到2030年将逐步增加到2万亿美元以上，但在NZE假设的情况下，到同一日期将需要超过4万亿美元。它补充说：“仍然迫切需要国际社会做出重大努力，以缩小发达经济体与新兴和发展中经济体之间令人担忧的清洁能源投资水平差距。”国际能源署表示：“核能在电力部门的持续作用取决于延长现有反应堆寿命的决定以及建造新反应堆项目的成功。”然而，它指出，在一些国家，对核电的投资正在“重新受到青睐”。“已经宣布延长现有反应堆的寿命，通常是作为应对当前危机的一部分...人们对小型模块化反应堆促进减排和电力系统可靠性的潜力越来越感兴趣”。世界核协会总干事Sama Bilbao y León在评论最新的WEO时说：“核能是IEA未来清洁能源愿景的基石。但核能有潜力做更多的事情", "中文源标题": "国际能源机构认为核能增长是世界应对能源危机的措施", "英文整编": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently released a new edition of World Energy Outlook Report (WEO).

This does not include the defense pensions of retired personnel.\nThis year, capital outlay meant for new weapons purchases for the Indian Air Force has been reserved for $7.43 billion; the Navy has been given $6.36 billion; and the Army has been allocated $4.28 billion.\nThe Indian Air Force will spend most of the money to cover existing commitments for French Rafale fighters, Russian S-400 air defense systems, Apache and Chinook helicopters, and Israeli medium-range surface-to-air missile systems.\nThe Navy will use its funds to pay for one aircraft carrier, destroyers, stealth frigates and multirole helicopters, which were previously contracted.\nThe Army will use its funds to pay for T-90 and Arjun MK1A battle tanks, BMP-2/2K infantry combat vehicles, Dhanush artillery guns, Akash air defense missiles, Konkurs-M and Milan-2T anti-tank guided missiles, and multiple types of ammunition.\nBut Amit Cowshish, a former MoD financial adviser for acquisitions, said it is unlikely the latest budget will fully meet requirements projected by the armed services.\nThe increase in the overall budget reflects the government’s resolve toward creating a self-sustainable industry with modern infrastructure — part of what’s known locally as Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or Self-Reliant India — the Ministry of Defence said.\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh welcomed the budget. “It is in line with the ‘Vocal for Local’ push and it will certainly boost the domestic defense industries,” he said, referring to the government’s call to support domestic businesses.\nSome defense analysts and military officials also welcomed the news, but noted the budget’s amount won’t be able cover modernization shortfalls.\nSenior military officials also warned business will continue as usual because nearly 70% of funds for arms procurement will go toward previous commitments with both domestic and foreign companies as well as via government-to-government deals. One Army official, who spoke to Defense News on the condition of anonymity, said indigenous procurement is a good notion but materiel produced by local companies still contain a significant amount of foreign-made technologies.\nLast year, the government allocated about $11.77 billionfrom the total $18.4 billion procurement budget for domestic companies to manufacture weapons and platforms locally. However, military officials who spoke to Defense News on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak to the media, said almost 85% of the contracts were awarded to state-run companies,leaving private firms struggling to secure meaningful defense orders.\nCowshish noted that reserving a portion of government funds for domestic purchases is a good sign for local industry, but that unless the overall budget is substantially increased, the present situation will endure.\nOne MoD official said state-run companies were awarded defense contracts for LCA MK1 fighters, Arjun MK1A battle tanks, tactical software-defined radios, low-level transportable radars, Lynx U2 fire control systems, kurs-M and Milan-2T anti-tank guided missiles, AK-203 assault rifles, and advanced light helicopters, among other materiel.\nThe government has also allocated $1.6 billion in the latest budget for defense research and development programs, which have been solely controlled by 50 laboratories of the state-run Defence Research and Development Organisation. Those programs will now be opened to industry and academia, with 25% of the defense R&D budget earmarked for this change, the MoD said, adding that private companies are encouraged to participate in the design and development of military platforms and equipment in collaboration with DRDO.\nThis is meant to give the private sector more exposure to defense R&D efforts. The Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers, which lobbies on behalf of industry, said the move is a much-needed reform that will encourage innovation and investment.\nAnother consequence of the move, according to Laxman Kumar Behera, an associate professor for national security studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, is that the DRDO, which has a near-monopoly on defense R&D efforts, will face greater competition.\nBudget documents also revealed that the Indian military spent about $2.8 billion on emergency procurements amid itsongoing standoff with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in the Ladakh region. China claims nearly 36,000 square milesof territory also claimed by India. The two countries fought a brief battle in 1962 over a boundary dispute, but it remains unresolved despite several bilateral diplomatic and military-to-military negotiations.\nThe new budget allocates $466.66 million for the state-run Border Roads Organisation for bolstering road-related infrastructure along India’s border, especially that shared with China. This is a 40% increase from last year’s allocation of $333.33 million.\nSimilarly, $566.13 million will go to the Indian Coast Guard to buy new ships and aircraft as well as to establish coastal security networks and other much-needed coastal security infrastructure. This amount is about 60% more than the previous year’s allocation of $353.33 million.\n", "中文原文": "新德里--印度周二宣布了新的国防预算，将有138.4亿美元用于促进当地企业的自力更生，并减少该国的进口依赖，用于购买新武器和军事平台的222.6亿美元基金。印度2022-2023财政年度的国防预算总额为542亿美元，其中包括202.6亿美元，用于支付15亿多军事人员的工资和津贴。这不包括退休人员的国防养恤金。今年，印度空军购买新武器的资本支出已预留74.3亿美元；海军获得了63.6亿美元；军队已经获得了42.8亿美元的拨款。印度空军将把大部分资金用于支付法国阵风战斗机、俄罗斯S-400防空系统、阿帕奇和奇努克直升机以及以色列中程地对空导弹系统的现有承诺。海军将用其资金支付一艘航空母舰、驱逐舰、隐形护卫舰和多用途直升机，这些都是以前签约的。陆军将用其资金支付T-90和阿琼MK1A主战坦克、BMP-2/2K步兵战车、Dhanush火炮、阿卡什防空导弹、Konkurs-M和Milan-2T反坦克制导导弹，以及多种类型的弹药。但前国防部采购财务顾问阿米特·考什（Amit Cowshish）表示，最新的预算不太可能完全满足武装部队的预期要求。国防部表示，总预算的增加反映了政府决心创建一个拥有现代基础设施的自我可持续工业--这是当地称为Aatmanirbhar Bharat或自力更生的印度的一部分。国防部长拉杰纳特·辛格对预算表示欢迎。“这符合‘为本土发声’的推动，肯定会提振国内国防工业，”他说，指的是政府支持国内企业的呼吁。一些国防分析师和军方官员也对这一消息表示欢迎，但指出预算金额无法弥补现代化的不足。高级军事官员还警告说，业务将照常进行，因为近70%的武器采购资金将用于此前与国内外公司的承诺，以及通过政府对政府的交易。一名不愿透露姓名的陆军官员接受《国防新闻》采访时表示，本土采购是一个好主意，但当地公司生产的材料仍含有大量外国制造的技术。去年，政府从184亿美元的采购预算中拨款约117.7亿美元，用于国内公司在当地制造武器和平台。然而，不愿透露姓名的军方官员在接受《国防新闻》采访时表示，近85%的合同授予了国营公司，这使得私营公司难以获得有意义的国防订单。Cowshish指出，保留一部分政府资金用于国内采购对当地工业来说是一个好迹象，但除非整体预算大幅增加，否则目前的情况将会持续下去。一名国防部官员表示，国营公司获得了LCA MK1战斗机、Arjun MK1A作战坦克、战术软件定义无线电、低空可运输雷达、Lynx U2火控系统、kurs-M和米兰-2T反坦克制导导弹、AK-203突击步枪和先进轻型直升机等物资的国防合同。政府还在最新预算中为国防研究和发展项目拨款16亿美元，这些项目由国营国防研究和发展组织的50个实验室单独控制。国防部表示，这些项目现在将向工业界和学术界开放，25%的国防研发预算专门用于这一变化，并补充说，鼓励私营公司与DRDO合作参与军事平台和设备的设计和开发。这是为了让私营部门更多地参与国防研发工作。代表工业进行游说的印度国防制造商协会表示，此举是一项急需的改革，将鼓励创新和投资。贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁大学国家安全研究副教授拉克斯曼·库马尔·贝赫拉（Laxman Kumar Behera）表示，此举的另一个后果是，在国防研发努力方面近乎垄断的DRDO将面临更大的竞争。预算文件还显示，印度军方在拉达克地区与中国人民解放军持续对峙的情况下，在紧急采购上花费了约28亿美元。中国声称拥有近36000平方英里的领土，印度也声称拥有主权。两国在1962年因边界争端打了一场短暂的战斗，但它", "中文源标题": "印度公布新国防预算旨在促进工业自力更生", "英文整编": "India announced its defense budget for fiscal year 2022-2023 on February 1, 2022, totaling $54.2 billion.

The device is composed of materials synthesized via a next-generation version of the chemical reaction for which three scientists won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\nPolymer film capacitors are electrical components that store and release energy within an electric field using a thin plastic layer as the insulating layer. They make up 50% of the global high voltage capacitor market and offer advantages including light weight, low cost, mechanical flexibility, and robust cyclability. But state-of-the-art polymer film capacitors decrease dramatically in performance with increasing temperature and voltages. Developing new materials with improved tolerance for heat and electric fields is paramount; and creating polymers with near-perfect chemistry offers a way to do so.\n“Our work adds a new class of electrically robust polymers to the table. It opens many possibilities to the exploration of more robust, high performing materials,” said Yi Liu, a chemist at Berkeley Lab and senior author on the Joule study reporting the work (\"High-performing polysulfate dielectrics for electrostatic energy storage under harsh conditions\"). Liu is the Facility Director of Organic and Macromolecular Synthesis at the Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science user facility at Berkeley Lab.\nIn addition to remaining stable when subjected to high temperatures, a capacitor needs to be a strong “dielectric” material, meaning that it remains a strong insulator when subjected to high voltages. However, few known materials systems exist that deliver both thermal stability and dielectric strength. This scarcity is due to a lack of reliable and convenient synthesis methods, as well as a lack of fundamental understanding of the relationship between polymer structure and properties. “Improving the thermal stability of existing films while retaining their electrical insulating strength is an ongoing materials challenge,” said Liu.\nA long-term collaboration between researchers at the Molecular Foundry and Scripps Research Institute has now met that challenge. They used a simple and quick chemical reaction developed in 2014 that swaps out fluorine atoms in compounds that contain sulfur-fluoride bonds, to yield long polymer chains of sulfate molecules called polysulfates.\nThis Sulfur-Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) reaction is a next-generation version of the click chemistry reaction pioneered by K. Barry Sharpless, a chemist at Scripps Research and two-time Nobel laureate in Chemistry, along with Peng Wu, also a chemist at Scripps Research. The near-perfect yet easy-to-run reactions join separate molecular entities through strong chemical bonds that form between different reactive groups. Liu’s team had originally used a variety of thermal analysis tools to examine the basic thermal and mechanical properties of these new materials.\nAs part of a Berkeley Lab program to synthesize and identify novel materials that could be useful in energy storage, Liu and his colleagues now find that, surprisingly, the polysulfates have outstanding dielectric properties, especially at high electric fields and temperatures. “Several commercial and lab-generated polymers are known for their dielectric properties, but polysulfates had never been considered. The marriage between polysulfates and dielectrics is one of the novelties here,” said He Li, a postdoctoral researcher in the Molecular Foundry and in Berkeley Lab’s Materials Sciences Division, and lead author of the study.\nInspired by the excellent baseline dielectric properties offered by polysulfates, the researchers deposited extremely thin layers of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) onto thin films of the material to engineer capacitor devices with enhanced energy storage performance. They discovered that the fabricated capacitors exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility, withstood electric fields of more than 750 million volts per meter, and performed efficiently at temperatures up to 150 degrees Celsius. In comparison, today’s benchmark commercial polymer capacitors only function reliably at temperatures lower than 120 degrees Celsius. Above that temperature, they can only withstand electric fields smaller than 500 million volts per meter, and the energy efficiency severely drops by over half.\nThe work opens new possibilities for exploring robust, high performing materials for energy storage. “We have provided deep insight into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the material’s excellent performance,” said Wu.\nThe polymer strikes a balance of electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties, likely due to the sulfate linkages introduced by the click chemistry reaction. Because modular chemistry accommodates extraordinary structural diversity and scalability, the same route could offer a viable path to new polymers with higher performance that meet even more demanding operational conditions.\nThe polysulfates are strong contenders to become new state-of-the-art polymer dielectrics. Once researchers overcome barriers in large-scale manufacturing processes for thin film materials, the devices could greatly improve the energy efficiency of integrated power systems in electric vehicles and enhance their operational reliability.\n“Who could have imagined that a wispy sulfate polymer film could fend off lightning and fire, two of the most destructive forces in the universe?!” said Sharpless.\n“We’re continuously pushing the envelope of thermal and electrical properties, and accelerating the lab-to-market transition,” Liu added.\n", "中文原文": "社会对高压电气技术--包括脉冲电力系统、汽车和电气化飞机以及可再生能源应用--日益增长的需求要求新一代电容器在强烈的热和电条件下储存和输送大量能量。能源部劳伦斯伯克利国家实验室（伯克利实验室）和斯克里普斯研究公司的研究人员现在开发了一种新的基于聚合物的设备，可以在承受极端温度和电场的同时有效地处理创纪录的能量。该装置由通过下一代化学反应合成的材料组成，三名科学家因此获得2022年诺贝尔化学奖。聚合物薄膜电容器是一种利用薄塑料层作为绝缘层在电场中存储和释放能量的电气元件。它们占全球高压电容器市场的50%，具有重量轻、成本低、机械灵活和可循环性强等优点。但是，随着温度和电压的升高，目前最先进的聚合物薄膜电容器的性能急剧下降。开发具有更好的耐热和电场能力的新材料是至关重要的；而创造具有近乎完美化学性质的聚合物提供了一种方法。“我们的工作增加了一类新的电鲁棒聚合物。它为探索更坚固、高性能的材料打开了许多可能性，“伯克利实验室的化学家、焦耳研究报告（”恶劣条件下用于静电储能的高性能聚硫酸盐电介质“）的资深作者刘毅说。刘是分子铸造厂的有机和大分子合成设施主任，分子铸造厂是美国能源部在伯克利实验室的科学用户设施办公室。除了在高温下保持稳定之外，电容器还需要是一种强大的“介电”材料，这意味着在高压下它仍然是一种强大的绝缘体。然而，很少有已知的材料系统能同时提供热稳定性和介电强度。这是由于缺乏可靠和方便的合成方法，以及缺乏对聚合物结构和性能之间关系的基本理解。“提高现有薄膜的热稳定性，同时保持其电绝缘强度是一个持续的材料挑战，”刘说。分子铸造公司和斯克里普斯研究所的研究人员之间的长期合作现在已经应对了这一挑战。他们使用了2014年开发的一种简单而快速的化学反应，该化学反应交换了含有硫-氟化物键的化合物中的氟原子，以产生称为多硫酸盐的硫酸分子的长聚合物链。这种硫-氟化物交换（SuFEx）反应是由斯克里普斯研究所的化学家、两届诺贝尔化学奖得主巴里·夏普莱斯（K.Barry Sharpless）和同样是斯克里普斯研究所的化学家彭武（Peng Wu）开创的点击化学反应的下一代版本。这种近乎完美但易于运行的反应通过在不同反应基团之间形成的强化学键将分离的分子实体连接起来。刘的团队最初使用了多种热分析工具来检查这些新材料的基本热和力学性能。作为伯克利实验室项目的一部分，刘和他的同事们现在发现，令人惊讶的是，多硫酸盐具有出色的介电性能，尤其是在高电场和温度下。“几种商业和实验室生成的聚合物以其介电性能而闻名，但多硫酸盐从未被考虑过。分子铸造厂和伯克利实验室材料科学部门的博士后研究员、该研究的主要作者何力说：“多硫酸盐和电介质之间的结合是这里的新奇之一。”受到多硫酸盐优异的基准介电性能的启发，研究人员在这种材料的薄膜上沉积了极薄的氧化铝(Al2O3)层，以设计具有增强储能性能的电容器器件。他们发现，所制造的电容器表现出出色的机械灵活性，承受每米超过7.5亿伏特的电场，并在高达150摄氏度的温度下高效工作。相比之下，今天的基准商用聚合物电容器只能在低于120摄氏度的温度下可靠地工作。在这个温度以上，它们只能承受小于每米5亿伏特的电场，能源效率严重下降一半以上。这项工作为探索坚固、高性能的储能材料开辟了新的可能性。“我们对潜在的机制提供了深入的见解", "中文源标题": "能承受极热和极电的新化合物可能导致下一代储能设备", "英文整编": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory of the US Department of Energy cooperated with Scripps Research Institute to manufacture a new type of polymer film capacitor using polysulfate, which can store and release high-density electric energy and withstand extreme temperature and electric field.

Chance Saltzman made it clear today that there “absolutely” are funds in the fiscal 2024 budget to pay for the new simulators and “digital twins” required.\n“I can’t give you the specific numbers yet, but we are investing in developing what I’m loosely calling an ‘operational test and training infrastructure,'” he told reporters at a Pentagon roundtable. “That’s kind of an umbrella concept, and it includes simulators, it includes ranges, it includes the testing equipment, it includes the digital engineering efforts.”\nSaltzman has focused on readiness as part of his recently issued “lines of effort” for making the Space Force a success. In a series of one-page “Commander’s Notes” published Jan. 18, he said his top priority is the need to field “combat ready forces” comprising not just weapon systems, but also the personnel to operate them and the logistics tail needed to sustain them.\nSaltzman explained that having the resources for training is important to meeting those readiness goals. To that end, he said the Space Force is working to “tighten those linkages” between the operators who need the training and the acquisition community, led by Air Force Assistant Secretary for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli, in order to ensure that operational requirements can be met.\n“Let’s not forget that [with] a lot of the things I’m talking about in terms of training and preparing, that’s also equipment that we have to buy — having high-fidelity simulators, having a virtual training environment, having the range infrastructure to practice this capability,” he said. “And we have to buy it quickly.”\nOne idea, he said, is to “take advantage of the work being done in acquisition and capabilities development” on creating “digital twins” for specific systems by “importing them into a training environment, so that “when a tactic is demonstrated in virtual space … we can actually draw conclusions” about whether it works or not.\n“Rather than waiting to see if it works in a live environment, let’s see if we can model it,” he added.\nThe Space Force’s Space Readiness and Training Command (STARCOM), led by Maj. Gen. Shawn Bratton, has been working since even before its official standup in August 2021 to define a training regime for Guardians to meet the challenges of today’s contested space domain that takes advantage of modern technology, but also includes, as much as possible, live training on satellite operations.\nThis includes creation of a new “architecture” for the future National Space Test and Training Complex (NSTTC), starting with initial funding in FY24, Bratton told reporters last May.\nHe further stressed that digital models and simulations will be key to both testing and training for the Space Force, and explained that the plan is to “reuse” digital models developed and validated by the Space Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC) for the development of force design, then provided to the acquisition gurus at Space Systems Command (SSC) to develop new weapon systems. In turn, he said, STARCOM will provide feedback to SWAC and SSC that will allow them to refine the models.\n", "中文原文": "“我还不能给你具体的数字，但我们正在投资开发我宽松地称之为作战测试和训练基础设施，”太空作战部长吉斯·萨尔茨曼将军在今天的圆桌会议上告诉记者。作者：特里萨·希钦斯2023年1月31日下午4时12分？华盛顿--创造一个数字训练环境是太空部队新首席执行官的一个关键优先事项，因为他专注于确保守护者做好准备，在未来冲突中面对美国太空系统不可避免的攻击。吉斯·萨尔茨曼将军今天明确表示，2024年财政预算中“绝对”有资金来支付所需的新模拟器和“数字双胞胎”。“我还不能给你具体的数字，但我们正在投资开发我称之为‘作战测试和训练基础设施’”，他在五角大楼的一次圆桌会议上告诉记者。“这是一种伞式概念，它包括模拟器，包括靶场，包括测试设备，包括数字工程努力。”萨尔茨曼将注意力集中在做好准备上，这是他最近发布的使太空部队取得成功的“努力方向”的一部分。在1月18日发表的一系列单页的“指挥官笔记”中，他表示，他的首要任务是需要派出“战斗准备部队”，不仅包括武器系统，还包括操作武器系统的人员和维持武器系统所需的后勤尾部。萨尔茨曼解释说，拥有培训资源对实现这些准备目标很重要。为此，他说，太空部队正在努力“加强需要培训的操作员和由空军负责太空采购和整合的助理部长弗兰克·卡尔维利（Frank Calvelli）领导的采购界之间的联系”，以确保作战要求能够得到满足。他说：“我们不要忘记，我在训练和准备方面谈到了很多东西，这也是我们必须购买的设备--有高保真模拟器，有虚拟训练环境，有练习这种能力的靶场基础设施。”“而且我们得赶紧买。”他说，一个想法是“利用在采购和能力开发方面正在进行的工作”，通过“将特定系统导入培训环境”，为它们创建“数字孪生系统”，以便“当一种策略在虚拟空间中演示时……我们实际上可以就它是否有效得出结论”。“与其等着看它在现场环境中是否有效，不如看看我们是否能为它建模，”他补充道。肖恩·布拉顿少将领导的太空部队空间准备和训练司令部(STARCOM)甚至在2021年8月正式站立之前就一直在努力为守护者定义一个训练制度，以应对当今有争议的空间领域的挑战，该制度利用现代技术，但也尽可能包括卫星操作的现场训练。布拉顿去年5月告诉记者，这包括为未来的国家空间测试和训练综合体(NSTTC)创建一个新的“架构”，从2014财年的初始资金开始。他进一步强调，数字模型和模拟将是太空部队测试和训练的关键，并解释说，该计划是“重用”由太空作战分析中心(SWAC)开发和验证的数字模型，用于部队设计的发展，然后提供给太空系统司令部(SSC)的采购专家，以开发新的武器系统。他说，反过来，STARCOM将向SWAC和SSC提供反馈，使他们能够改进模型。", "中文源标题": "太空部队负责人：24财年预算为数字化训练提供资金，作为战备推进的一部分", "英文整编": "On January 31, Admiral Salzman, the US-Pacific Air Force Operations Minister, said that part of the 2024 fiscal year budget would be invested in the combat test and training infrastructure, including: First, the acquisition of high-fidelity simulators, virtual training environments, shooting ranges and other combat readiness infrastructure.

From a physical viewpoint, these particles clump together and start to behave as though they are part of a single larger particle. The 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the realization of Bose-Einstein condensation. This phenomenal breakthrough was first achieved in a collection of rubidium atoms at an ultra-low temperature of 20 nK. This control of the state of matter is expected to lead to technological breakthroughs, and also enables the realization of superfluidity.\nIn this work, Prof Quek Su Ying from the Department of Physics, National University of Singapore, and her postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Ulman Kanchan, predicted that Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) can take place at around 50 K to 100 K in organic 2D material systems (see Figure) through their computation. This BEC temperature is orders of magnitude higher than that previously achieved using atoms. The particles that condense in the organic-2D material systems are bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) that are induced in the system through irradiation with light. The electron resides in the 2D semiconductor (molybdenum disulphide, MoS2) and the hole in the organic molecule (zinc phthalocyanine, ZnPc), in what is called a \"charge transfer exciton.\" The spatial separation between the electron and hole, together with the strongly bound nature of the excitons in these low dimensional materials, results in long exciton lifetimes, which are critical for BEC to take place. Crucially, the predicted BEC temperature is much higher than that in atoms. This is because the BEC temperature is inversely proportional to the particle mass, and the exciton mass is much smaller than typical atomic masses.\nPrior to this prediction, BEC of charge transfer excitons was observed at around 100 K in bilayers of 2D materials. However, one practical difficulty in the realization of BEC in these systems was the need for careful alignment of the two layers of material. Misaligned bilayers host excitons with large momentum, which hinder the formation of the condensate. In the case of organic-2D material systems, the narrow bandwidth of the molecular states imply that the charge transfer excitons have very small momentum, thus favoring BEC formation.\nProf Quek said, \"Organic molecules such as transition metal phthalocyanines readily form ordered, self-assembled monolayers on 2D materials. The prediction of high temperature BEC of excitons in organic-2D material systems is expected to lead to more practical realizations of this exotic state of matter, and paves the way for the study of intriguing applications related to Bose-Einstein condensates.\"\n", "中文原文": "新加坡国立大学的研究人员预测，在由二维(2D)半导体材料上的有机分子组成的系统中，一种被称为玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体的奇异物质状态可以在相对较高的温度下（约50 K至100 K）存在。玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚是一种物质状态，其中所有粒子都具有相同的能量，并且完全协调。从物理的观点来看，这些粒子聚集在一起，开始表现得好像是单个较大粒子的一部分。2001年诺贝尔物理学奖因玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的实现而获颁。这一惊人的突破首先是在20纳克的超低温下在铷原子集合中实现的。这种对物质状态的控制有望导致技术突破，也使超流动得以实现。在这项工作中，新加坡国立大学物理系的Quek Su Ying教授和她的博士后Ulman Kanchan博士通过他们的计算，预测了在有机二维材料体系中，玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚(BEC)可以在50-100 K之间发生（见图）。这个BEC温度比以前用原子实现的温度高出一个数量级。在有机-二维材料系统中凝聚的粒子是通过光照射在系统中诱导的束缚电子-空穴对（激子）。电子驻留在二维半导体（二硫化钼，MoS2)和有机分子（酞菁锌，ZnPc)中的空穴中，处于所谓的“电荷转移激子”中。电子和空穴之间的空间分离，以及低维材料中激子的强束缚特性，导致了长的激子寿命，这是BEC发生的关键。至关重要的是，预测的BEC温度比原子中的温度高得多。这是因为BEC温度与粒子质量成反比，激子质量比典型原子质量小得多。在此之前，我们在100K左右的二维双层材料中观察到了电荷转移激子的BEC。然而，在这些系统中实现BEC的一个实际困难是需要仔细地对齐两层材料。不对齐的双层含有动量大的激子，这阻碍了凝聚体的形成。在有机2D材料体系中，分子态的窄带宽意味着电荷转移激子具有很小的动量，从而有利于BEC的形成。Quek教授说：“像过渡金属酞菁这样的有机分子很容易在二维材料上形成有序的自组装单层。对有机-二维材料体系中激子的高温BEC的预测有望导致更实际地实现这种奇异的物质状态，并为研究玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体的有趣应用铺平道路。”", "中文源标题": "激子高温玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚的预测", "英文整编": "Recently, the National University of Singapore found that there is a strange Bose Einstein condensate in the organic molecules of two-dimensional semiconductor materials.
